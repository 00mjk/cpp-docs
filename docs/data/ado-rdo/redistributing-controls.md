# Redistributing Controls
Visual C++ .NET supplies ActiveX controls that you can use in applications. You can then redistribute the controls along with the applications. In the **Insert ActiveX Control** dialog box, highlighting a control will display its .ocx or .dll file.  
  
 For a list of the redistributable Visual C++â€“supplied ActiveX controls, see Program Files\Microsoft  Visual Studio 2003\redist.txt on Disc 2 of the Visual C++ .NET product CD-ROM; any .ocx files in the Win\System folder are redistributable.  
  
 [MFC ActiveX Controls: Distributing ActiveX Controls](../../mfc/mfc-activex-controls-distributing-activex-controls.md) explains how to install and register redistributable ActiveX controls.  
  
 [Merge Module Projects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/e92e4f85-fba5-45ee-a432-892a956daeb9) explains how  Visual Studio deployment handles the redistribution of files through merge modules.  
  
 If your application uses an ActiveX control that connects to a database, you need to install or do the following:  
  
-   **Replicate the DSN.** You also need to replicate the data source name on the target computer. You can do this programmatically with functions such as [ConfigDSN](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms709275.aspx).  
  
## Important Notes on Component Redistribution  
  
 
-   **Known problems with ActiveX controls.** There is a known problem with dynamically creating instances of redistributable ActiveX controls on computers on which Visual C++ has not been installed, as described in the Knowledge Base article, "PRB: Dynamic Creation of Redistributable Control Fails" (Q151804). You can find Knowledge Base articles on the MSDN Library CD-ROM or at [http://support.microsoft.com](http://support.microsoft.com). There is also a known problem with placing some ActiveX controls on a dialog box; you get a message box stating that the control requires a design-time license, as described in the Knowledge Base article, "PRB: Need Design-Time License for Microsoft ActiveX Controls" (Q155059). You can find Knowledge Base articles on the MSDN Library CD-ROM or at [http://support.microsoft.com](http://support.microsoft.com).  
  
-   **Visual Studio licensed controls.** Visual Studio licensees can redistribute additional ActiveX controls specific to the other Visual Studio development tools. For example, the Chart control is distributed with Visual Basic, which also ships in Visual Studio. Thus, if you are using Visual C++ as a part of a Visual Studio license, you can redistribute the Chart control. However, if you purchased only Visual C++, you do not have a license to redistribute it.
