# Deleting a Version Information Block
### To delete a version information block  
  
1.  Open the version information resource by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Right-click the block header you wish to delete then choose **Delete Version Info Block** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     This command deletes the selected header and leaves the remaining version information intact. Please note you cannot undo the action.
