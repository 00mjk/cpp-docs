# Resource Files (C++)

> [!NOTE]
> Since projects in .NET programming languages do not use resource script files, you must open your resources from **Solution Explorer**. You can use the [Image editor](../windows/image-editor-for-icons.md) and the [Binary editor](binary-editor.md) to work with resource files in managed projects. Any managed resources you want to edit must be linked resources. The Visual Studio resource editors do not support editing embedded resources.

The term "resource file" can refer to a number of file types, including:

- The resource script (.rc) file of a program.

- A resource template (.rct) file.

- An individual resource existing as a stand-alone file, such as a bitmap, icon, or cursor file that is referred to from an .rc file.

- A header file generated by the development environment, for example Resource.h, that is referred to from an .rc file.

Resources are also found in other file types such as .exe, .dll, and .res files. You can work with resources and resource files from within your project and the ones that aren't part of your current project. You can also work with resource files that weren't created in the development environment of Visual Studio. For example, you can:

- Work with nested and conditionally included resource files.

- Update existing resources or convert them to Visual C++ format.

- Import or export graphic resources to or from your current resource file.

- Include shared or read-only identifiers (symbols) that can't be modified by the development environment.

- Include resources in your executable (.exe) file that don't require editing (or that shouldn't be edited) during your current project, such as shared resources between several projects.

- Include resource types not supported by the development environment.

This section covers how to:

- [Create Resources](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md)

- [Manage Resources](../windows/how-to-copy-resources.md)

- [Include Resources at Compile Time](../windows/how-to-include-resources-at-compile-time.md)

## Editable Resource File Types

The following types of files can be opened to edit the resources they contain:

|File name|Description|
|---------|-----------------|
|.rc|Resource script files|
|.rct|Resource template files|
|.res|Resource files|
|.resx|Managed resource files|
|.exe|Executable files|
|.dll|Dynamic-link library files|
|.bmp, .ico, .dib, and .cur|Bitmap, icon, toolbar and cursor files.|

The Visual Studio environment works with and affects the following files during your resource editing session:

|File name|Description|
|---------------|-----------------|
|Resource.h|Header file generated by the development environment; contains symbol definitions. (Include this file in source control.)|
|Filename.aps|Binary version of the current resource script file; used for quick loading.<br /><br /> The resource editors don't directly read .rc or resource.h files. The resource compiler compiles them into .aps files, which are consumed by the resource editors. This file is a compile step and only stores symbolic data. As with a normal compile process, information that isn't symbolic (for example, comments) is discarded during the compile process. Whenever the .aps file gets out of synch with the .rc file, the .rc file is regenerated (for example, when you Save, the resource editor overwrites the .rc file and the resource.h file). Any changes to the resources themselves will remain incorporated in the .rc file, but comments will always be lost once the .rc file is overwritten. For information on how to preserve comments, see [Include Resources at Compile Time](../windows/how-to-include-resources-at-compile-time.md). (Typically, you shouldn't include the .aps file in source control.)|
|.rc|Resource script file that contains script for the resources in your current project. This file is overwritten by the .aps file whenever you save. (Include this file in source control.)|

## Manifest Resources

In C++ desktop projects, manifest resources are XML files that describe the dependencies that an application uses. For example, in Visual Studio, the MFC wizard-generated manifest file defines which of the Windows common control DLLs the application should use, version 5.0 or 6.0:

```xml
<description>Your app description here</description>
<dependency>
    <dependentAssembly>
        <assemblyIdentity
            type="win32"
            name="Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls"
            version="6.0.0.0"
            processorArchitecture="X86"
            publicKeyToken="6595b64144ccf1df"
            language="*"
        />
    </dependentAssembly>
</dependency>
```

For a Windows XP or Windows Vista application, the manifest resource not only specifies that the application use the most current version of the Windows common controls, v6.0, as seen above, but it also supports the [Syslink control](/windows/desktop/Controls/syslink-overview).

To view the version and type information contained in a manifest resource, you can open the file in an XML viewer or in the Visual Studio text editor. If you open a manifest resource from [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), the resource will open in binary format. To view the contents of a manifest resource in a more viewable format, you must open the resource from **Solution Explorer**.

### To open a manifest resource

1. Open your project in Visual Studio.

1. Navigate to **Solution Explorer** and expand the **Resource Files** folder.

   - For text editor, double-click the .manifest file.

   - For other editors, right-click the .manifest file and select **Open With...**, then specify the editor to use and choose **Open**.

> [!NOTE]
> You can only have one manifest resource per module.
