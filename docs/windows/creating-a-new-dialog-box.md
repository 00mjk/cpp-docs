# Creating a New Dialog Box
### To create a new dialog box  
  
1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), right-click your .rc file, then choose **Add Resource** from the shortcut menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  In the **Add Resource** dialog box, select **Dialog** in the **Resource Type** list, then click **New**.  
  
     If a plus sign (+) appears next to the Dialog resource type, it means that dialog box templates are available. Click the plus sign to expand the list of templates, select a template, and click New.  
  
     The new dialog box opens in the Dialog editor.  
  
     You can also [open existing dialog boxes in the Dialog Box editor for editing](../windows/viewing-and-editing-resources-in-a-resource-editor.md).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f45fce5x.aspx) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/xbx3z216.aspx). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/h6270d0z.aspx).
