# Specifying the Dominant Control
The control selected first is the dominant control.  
  
### To specify the dominant control  
  
1.  Hold down the **CTRL** key and click the control you want to use to influence the size or location of other controls *first*.  
  
     **Note** The sizing handles of the dominant control are solid while the handles of subordinate controls are hollow. All further resizing or alignment is based on the dominant control.  
  
### To change the dominant control  
  
1.  Clear the current selection by clicking outside all the currently selected controls.  
  
2.  Repeat the previous procedure, selecting a different control first.
