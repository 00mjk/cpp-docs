# Adding Version Information for Another Language
### To add version information for another language (new info block)  
  
1.  Open a version information resource by double-clicking it in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Right-click within the version information table and choose **New Version Info Block** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     This command adds an additional information block to the current version information resource and opens its corresponding properties in the [Properties window](/visualstudio/ide/reference/properties-window).  
  
3.  In the **Properties** window, choose the appropriate language and character set for your new block.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f45fce5x.aspx) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/xbx3z216.aspx). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/h6270d0z.aspx).
