# Moving a String from One Resource File to Another
### To move a string from one resource script file to another  
  
1.  Open the string tables in both .rc files. (For more information, see [Viewing Resources in a Resource Script File Outside of a Project](../windows/how-to--open-a-resource-script-file-outside-of-a-project--standalone-.md).)  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to--create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Right-click the string you want to move and choose **Cut** from the shortcut menu.  
  
3.  Place the cursor in the target **String Editor** window.  
  
4.  In the .rc file to which you want to move the string, right-click and choose **Paste** from the shortcut menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If the **ID** or **value** of the moved string conflicts with an existing **ID** or **value** in the destination file, either the **ID** or the **value** of the moved string changes. If a string exists with the same **ID**, the **ID** of the moved string changes. If a string exists with the same **value**, the **value** of the moved string changes.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects (those that target the common language runtime), please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](assetId:///9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).
