# Menu Editor

Menus allow you to arrange commands in a logical and easy-to-find fashion. With the **Menu** editor, you can create and edit menus by working directly with a menu bar that closely resembles the one in your finished application.

For Visual C++ projects, you can use the **Menu** editor to:

- [Create Menus](../windows/creating-a-menu.md)

- [Change Menu Command Properties](../windows/menu-command-properties.md)

   > [!TIP]
   > While using the **Menu** editor, in many instances, you can click the right mouse button to display a pop-up menu of frequently used commands. The commands available depend on what the pointer is pointing to.

   > [!NOTE]
   > For Microsoft Foundation Class Library (MFC) programs and ATL programs, you can use **Code Wizards** to hook menu commands to code. For more information, see [Adding an Event](../ide/adding-an-event-visual-cpp.md).
