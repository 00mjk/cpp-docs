# Displaying or Hiding the Toolbar (Image Editor for Icons)
Since many of the drawing tools are available from the [keyboard](../windows/accelerator-keys-image-editor-for-icons.md), it is sometimes useful to hide the Image Editor toolbar.  
  
### To display or hide the Image Editor toolbar  
  
1.  On the **View** menu click **Toolbars** then choose **Image Editor**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Elements from this toolbar will appear unavailable when an image file from the current project or solution is not open in the Image Editor. See [Creating an Icon or Other Image](../windows/creating-an-icon-or-other-image-image-editor-for-icons.md), for information on adding image files to your projects.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Desktop Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/f45fce5x.aspx) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resource strings to properties, see [Creating Resource Files for Desktop Apps](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/xbx3z216.aspx). For information on globalization and localization of resources in managed apps, see [Globalizing and Localizing .NET Framework Applications](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/h6270d0z.aspx).
