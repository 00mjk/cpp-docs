# Displaying or Hiding the Toolbar (Image Editor for Icons)
Since many of the drawing tools are available from the [keyboard](../mfc/accelerator-keys-image-editor-for-icons.md), it is sometimes useful to hide the Image Editor toolbar.  
  
### To display or hide the Image Editor toolbar  
  
1.  On the **View** menu click **Toolbars** then choose **Image Editor**.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  Elements from this toolbar will appear unavailable when an image file from the current project or solution is not open in the Image Editor. See [Creating an Icon or Other Image](../mfc/creating-an-icon-or-other-image-image-editor-for-icons.md), for information on adding image files to your projects.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).
