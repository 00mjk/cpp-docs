# Adding, Editing, or Deleting Controls

Using the **Dialog** editor, you can add, resize, edit, and delete controls in dialog boxes. You can also edit the properties of a control, such as its ID, or whether it is initially visible at run time.

You can use the shortcut menu in the **Dialog** editor to quickly add registered ActiveX controls to a dialog box, and you can add ActiveX controls to the **Toolbox** for quick access (for more information, see [Toolbox](/visualstudio/ide/reference/toolbox)).
