# Constants in Primary Expressions
A constant operand has the value and type of the constant value it represents. A character constant has `int` type. An integer constant has `int`, **long**, `unsigned int`, or `unsigned long` type, depending on the integer's size and on the way the value is specified. See [Constants](../c/c-constants.md) for more information.
