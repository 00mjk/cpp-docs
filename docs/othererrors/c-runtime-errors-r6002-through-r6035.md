# C Runtime Errors R6002 through R6035
This section is a reference to the errors that can be generated by the C Runtime Library (CRT) when your app is loaded or running. These are errors that indicate either a bug in your app's code, or a condition that the runtime library can't handle, such as low memory. End users of your app may see these errors if you do not code your app to prevent the conditions that cause them.
