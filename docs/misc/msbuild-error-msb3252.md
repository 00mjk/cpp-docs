# MSBuild Error MSB3252
**MSB3252: The project has a reference to assembly \<name>. This assembly is not part of the .NET Framework Client Profile.  By not having this reference there may be compile or runtime errors.**  
  
 A call was made to a member in an assembly, or dependent assembly, that is not part of the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../misc/includes/net_client_v35_long_md.md)]. Therefore, the call cannot be resolved and the application cannot be compiled.  
  
 For more information about the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../misc/includes/net_client_v35_long_md.md)], see [.NET Framework Client Profile](../Topic/.NET%20Framework%20Client%20Profile.md).  
  
### To correct this error  
  
-   Either remove the specified assembly reference from your project, or target the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../error-messages/tool-errors/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)] instead of the [!INCLUDE[net_client_v35_long](../misc/includes/net_client_v35_long_md.md)] subset library. For information about how to target the full [!INCLUDE[dnprdnshort](../error-messages/tool-errors/includes/dnprdnshort_md.md)], see [How to: Target a Version of the .NET Framework](../Topic/How%20to:%20Target%20a%20Version%20of%20the%20.NET%20Framework.md).
