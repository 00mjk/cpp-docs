# sequenced_policy Class

Used as a unique type to disambiguate parallel algorithm overloading and require that a parallel algorithmâ€™s execution may not be parallelized.

## Syntax

```cpp
class execution::sequenced_policy;
```

## Remarks

During the execution of a parallel algorithm with the `execution::sequenced_policy` policy, if the invocation of an element access function exits via an uncaught exception, `terminate()` shall be called.

## Requirements

**Header:** \<execution>

**Namespace:** std::execution
