### Operators  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[operator!=](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#op_neq)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator<](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#op_lt)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is less than the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator\<=](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator==](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#op_eq_eq)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is equal to the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator>](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#op_gt)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is greater than the queue object on the right side.|  
|[operator>=](../standard-library/queue-operators.md#op_gt_eq)|Tests if the queue object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the queue object on the right side.|  
  
### Classes  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[queue Class](../standard-library/queue-class.md)|A template container adaptor class that provides a restriction of functionality limiting access to the front and back elements of some underlying container type.|  
|[priority_queue Class](../standard-library/priority-queue-class.md)|A template container adaptor class that provides a restriction of functionality limiting access to the top element of some underlying container type, which is always the largest.|
