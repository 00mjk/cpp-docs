# Cloud and Web Development with C++

For asynchronous networking, we recommend the open-source Microsoft [C++ REST SDK](https://github.com/Microsoft/cpprestsdk). Other networking libraries are available through [vcpkg](../build/vcpkg.md).

Use ANSI C99 [Azure IoT Hub SDKs](/azure/iot-hub/iot-hub-devguide-sdks) for Internet of Things applications that run on the device or on the backend.

The [Microsoft Azure Storage Client Library for C++](https://azure.github.io/azure-storage-cpp/) allows you to build applications against Microsoft Azure Storage(azure/storage/common/storage-introduction).

For more information, see the [Microsoft Azure C and C++ Developer Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/develop/cpp/).
