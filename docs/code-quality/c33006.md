# C33006

> Warning C33006: VARIANT 'var' was provided as a parameter without SAL and may have been cleared when
> it was not initialized. (expression 'expr')

This warning is triggered when unannotated VARIANT parameters are encountered. If a parameter is not
annotated with \_In\_ or \_Inout\_ SAL annotation, it cannot be determined whether the parameter has
been initialiszed.

## Example

```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

void foo(VARIANT* v)
{
    VariantClear(v);    // C33006
    //......
}
```

These warnings are corrected by ensuring VariantClear is called only for a properly initialized VARIANT:
```cpp
#include <Windows.h>

void foo(VARIANT* v)
{
    VariantInit(v);
    VariantClear(v);    // OK
    //......
}
```
