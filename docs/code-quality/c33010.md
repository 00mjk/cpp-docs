# C33010

> Warning C33010: Unchecked lower bound for enum 'enum' used as index.

This warning is triggered when the upper bound of the enum used as index into an array is checked,
but the lower bound is not checked.

## Example

Code using enumerated types as indexes into arrays will often check for an upper bound
to ensure the index is not out of range. By default an enum variable is signed, and
therefore it is important to ensure that it cannot take on a negative value.
When the enum is subsequently used to index an array, or worse an array of function pointers,
then a negative enum value would lead to potentially arbitrary memory being read,
used and/or executed.

```cpp
typedef void (*PFN)();

enum class Index
{
    Zero,
    One,
    Two,
    Three,
    Max
};

void foo(Index idx, PFN(&functions)[5])
{
    if (idx > Index::Max)
        return;

    auto pfn = functions[static_cast<int>(idx)];    // C33010
    if (pfn != nullptr)
        (*pfn)();
    // ......
}
```
These warnings are corrected by checking the index value for lower bound as well:

```cpp
typedef void (*PFN)();

enum class Index
{
    Zero,
    One,
    Two,
    Three,
    Max
};

void foo(Index idx, PFN(&functions)[5])
{
    if (idx < Index::Zero || idx > Index::Max)
        return;

    auto pfn = functions[static_cast<int>(idx)];    // OK
    if (pfn != nullptr)
        (*pfn)();
    // ......
}
```
