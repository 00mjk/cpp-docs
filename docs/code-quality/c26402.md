# C26402â€¯DONT_HEAP_ALLOCATE_MOVABLE_RESULT

To avoid confusion about whether a pointer owns an object, a function that returns a movable object should allocate it on the stack and return it by value instead of returning a heap-allocated object. If pointer semantics are required, then return a smart pointer instead of a raw pointer. See [C++ Core Guidelines R.3](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines/blob/master/CppCoreGuidelines.md#Rr-ptr): *Warn if a function returns an object that was allocated within the function but has a move constructor. Suggest considering returning it by value instead.*

# Example
```cpp
struct S
{
  S() = default;
  S(S&& s) = default;
};

S* foo()
{
  S* s = new S(); // C26409, avoid explicitly calling new.
  // ... 
  return s; // C26402
}

// Prefer returning objects with move contructors by value instead of unnecessarily heap-allocating the object.
S bar()
{
  S s;
  // ...
  return s;
}
```
