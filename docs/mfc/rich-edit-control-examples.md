# Rich Edit Control Examples

The MFC OLE sample [WORDPAD](../visual-cpp-samples.md) uses the `CRichEditView`, `CRichEditDoc`, and `CRichEditCntrItem` classes. By extension, it uses the [CRichEditCtrl](../mfc/reference/cricheditctrl-class.md). For a quick description of these three classes, see [Classes Related to Rich Edit Controls](../mfc/classes-related-to-rich-edit-controls.md).
