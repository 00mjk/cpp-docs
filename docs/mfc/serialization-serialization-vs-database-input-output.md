# Serialization: Serialization vs. Database Input/Output
This article explains when to use document objects and serialization for file-based input/output (I/O) and when other I/O techniques are appropriate â€” because the application reads and writes data on a per-transaction basis, as in database applications. If you don't use serialization, you also won't need the File Open, Save, and Save As commands. Topics covered include:  
  
-   [Recommendations for handling input/output](../mfc/recommendations-for-handling-input-output.md)  
  
-   [Handling the File menu in database applications](../mfc/file-menu-in-an-mfc-database-application.md)
