# Adding Version Information for Another Language
### To add version information for another language (new info block)  
  
1.  Open a version information resource by double-clicking it in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Right-click within the version information table and choose **New Version Info Block** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     This command adds an additional information block to the current version information resource and opens its corresponding properties in the [Properties window](/visual-studio/ide/reference/properties-window).  
  
3.  In the **Properties** window, choose the appropriate language and character set for your new block.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).  
  
 **Requirements**
