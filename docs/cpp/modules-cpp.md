# Overview of modules in C++

C++20 introduces *modules*, a modern solution for componentization of C++ libraries and programs. Modules eliminate or greatly reduce many of the problems associated with the use of header files, and also potentially reduce compilation times. 
When you *import* a module, you gain access to its public interface, which consists of types and functions that the module *exports*.
