# Basic Concepts  (C++)
This section explains concepts that are critical to understanding C++. C programmers will be familiar with many of these concepts, but there are some subtle differences that can cause unexpected program results. The following topics are included:  
  
-   [Declarations and definitions](../cpp/declarations-and-definitions--c---.md)  
  
-   [Scope of a C++ object or function](../cpp/scope--visual-c---.md)  
  
-   [Program definition and linkage rules](../cpp/program-and-linkage---c---.md)  
  
-   [Startup and termination](../cpp/startup-and-termination--c---.md)  
  
-   [L-values and r-values](../cpp/lvalues-and-rvalues--visual-c---.md)  
  
-   [Temporary Objects](../cpp/temporary-objects.md)  
  
-   [Alignment](../cpp/alignment--c---declarations-.md)  
  
-   [alignof and alignas](../cpp/alignof-and-alignas--c---.md)  
  
-   [Trivial, standard-layout and POD types](../cpp/trivial--standard-layout--and-pod-types.md)
