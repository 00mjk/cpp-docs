# Lexical Conventions
This section introduces the fundamental elements of a C++ program. You use these elements, called "lexical elements" or "tokens" to construct statements, definitions, declarations, and so on, which are used to construct complete programs. The following lexical elements are discussed in this section:

- [Overview of File Translation](overview-of-file-translation.md)
- [Character Sets](../cpp/character-sets.md)

- [Tokens](../cpp/tokens-cpp.md)

- [Comments](../cpp/comments-cpp.md)

- [Identifiers](../cpp/identifiers-cpp.md)

- [Keywords](../cpp/keywords-cpp.md)

- [Punctuators](../cpp/punctuators-cpp.md)

- [Numeric, Boolean, and Pointer Literals](../cpp/numeric-boolean-and-pointer-literals-cpp.md)

- [String and Character Literals](../cpp/string-and-character-literals-cpp.md)

- [User-Defined Literals](../cpp/user-defined-literals-cpp.md)
