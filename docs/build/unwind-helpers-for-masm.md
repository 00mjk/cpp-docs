# Unwind Helpers for MASM

In order to write proper assembly routines, there are a set of pseudo-operations that can be used in parallel with the actual assembly instructions to create the appropriate .pdata and .xdata. There are also a set of macros that provide simplified use of the pseudo-operations for their most common uses.

## Remarks

The following topics are in this section:

- [Raw Pseudo Operations](raw-pseudo-operations.md)

- [MASM Macros](masm-macros.md)
