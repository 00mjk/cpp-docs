ConnectionManager.exe is a command-line utility to manage remote development connections outside of Visual Studio. It's useful for tasks such as provisioning a new development machine. Or, use it to set up Visual Studio for continuous integration.Â You can use it in a Developer Command Prompt window.

ConnectionManager.exe is available in Visual Studio 2019 version 16.5 and later. It's installed automatically when you choose the **Connection Manager** component in the Visual Studio Installer. By default, it's installed in *%VCIDEInstallDir%\\Linux\\bin\\ConnectionManager.exe*.

The functionality of ConnectionManager.exe is also available in Visual Studio. To manage remote development connections in the IDE, on the menu bar, choose **Tools** > **Options** to open the Options dialog. In the Options dialog, select **Cross Platform** > **Connection Manager**.
