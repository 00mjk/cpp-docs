**Choices**

- **None** - Produces no debugging information, so compilation may be faster.
- **C7 compatible** - Select the type of debugging information created for your program and whether this information is kept in object (.obj) files or in a program database (PDB).
- **Program Database** - Produces a program database (PDB) that contains type information and symbolic debugging information for use with the debugger. The symbolic debugging information includes the names and types of variables, as well as functions and line numbers.
- **Program Database for Edit And Continue** - Produces a program database, as described above, in a format that supports the Edit and Continue feature.

### Support Just My Code Debugging

Adds supporting code for enabling Just My Code debugging in this compilation unit.  (/JMC)

### Common Language RunTime Support

Use the .NET runtime service.  This switch is incompatible with some other switches; see the documentation on the /clr family of switches for details.

**Choices**

- **No Common Language RunTime Support** - No Common Language RunTime Support
- **Common Language RunTime Support** - Creates metadata for your application that can be consumed by other CLR applications, and allows your application to consume types and data in the metadata of other CLR components.

### Consume Windows Runtime Extension

Consume the Windows Run Time languages extensions.  (/ZW)

### Suppress Startup Banner

Suppresses the display of the sign-on banner when the compiler starts up and display of informational messages during compiling.

### Warning Level

Select how strict you want the compiler to be about code errors. (/W0 - /W4)

### Enable Intrinsic Functions

Enables intrinsic functions.  Using intrinsic functions generates faster, but possibly larger, code. (/Oi)

### Favor Size Or Speed

Whether to favor code size or code speed; 'Global Optimization' must be turned on. (/Ot, /Os)

**Choices**

- **Favor small code** - Favor Small Code. Minimizes the size of EXEs and DLLs by instructing the compiler to favor size over speed.

### Preprocess Suppress Line Numbers

Preprocess without #line directives.

### Keep Comments

Suppresses comment strip from source code; requires that one of the 'Preprocessing' options be set. (/C)

## C/C++ Code Generation Properties

### Enable Minimal Rebuild

Enables minimal rebuild, which determines whether C++ source files that include changed C++ class definitions (stored in header (.h) files) need to be recompiled.

### Enable C++ Exceptions

Specifies the model of exception handling to be used by the compiler.

**Choices**

- **Yes with SEH Exceptions** - The exception-handling model that catches asynchronous (structured) and synchronous (C++) exceptions. (/EHa)
- **Yes** - The exception-handling model that catches C++ exceptions only and tells the compiler to assume that extern C functions never throw a C++ exception. (/EHsc)

**Choices**

- **Multi-threaded** - Causes your application to use the multithread, static version of the run-time library.
- **Multi-threaded Debug** - Defines _DEBUG and _MT. This option also causes the compiler to place the library name LIBCMTD.lib into the .obj file so that the linker will use LIBCMTD.lib to resolve external symbols.
- **Multi-threaded DLL** - Causes your application to use the multithread- and DLL-specific version of the run-time library. Defines _MT and _DLL and causes the compiler to place the library name MSVCRT.lib into the .obj file.
- **Multi-threaded Debug DLL** - Defines _DEBUG, _MT, and _DLL and causes your application to use the debug multithread- and DLL-specific version of the run-time library. It also causes the compiler to place the library name MSVCRTD.lib into the .obj file.

### Enable Parallel Code Generation

Allows the compiler to generate parallel code for loops identified using #pragma loop(hint_parallel\[(n)]) when optimization is enabled.

### Enable Enhanced Instruction Set

Enable use of instructions found on processors that support enhanced instruction sets, e.g., the SSE, SSE2, AVX, and AVX2 enhancements to IA-32; AVX and AVX2 to x64. Currently /arch:SSE and /arch:SSE2 are only available when building for the x86 architecture. If no option is specified, the compiler will use instructions found on processors that support SSE2.

When used with /fp:except-, /fp:strict enforces strict floating-point semantics but without respect for exceptional events.
- **Fast** - Creates the fastest code in the majority of cases.

### Enable Floating Point Exceptions

Reliable floating-point exception model. Exceptions will be raised immediately after they are triggered.  (/fp:except)

### Create Hotpatchable Image

When hotpatching is on, the compiler ensures that first instruction of each function is two bytes, which is required for hot patching.  (/hotpatch)
