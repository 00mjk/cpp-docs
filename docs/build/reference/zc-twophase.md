# /Zc:twoPhase- (disable two-phase name lookup)

When the **/Zc:twoPhase-** option is specified, the compiler parses and instantiates class templates and function templates in the same non-conforming way as versions of Visual Studio before Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3. 

## Syntax

> **/Zc:twoPhase-**

## Remarks

In Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3 and later, by default, the compiler uses two-phase name lookup for template name resolution. If **/Zc:twoPhase-** is specified, the compiler reverts to its previous non-conforming class template and function template name resolution and substitution behavior.

The **/Zc:twoPhase-** option to enable non-conforming behavior is not set by default. The [/permissive-](permissive-standards-conformance.md) option implicitly sets the conforming compiler behavior, but it can be overridden by using **/Zc:twoPhase-**.

Use **/Zc:twoPhase-** if your code requires the old behavior to compile correctly. Strongly consider updating your code to conform to the standard.

### Compiler behavior under /Zc:twoPhase-

In versions of the compiler before Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, and when **/Zc:twoPhase-** is specified, the compiler uses this behavior:

- It parses only the template declaration, the class head, and the base class list. The template body is captured as a token stream. No function bodies, initializers, default arguments, or noexcept arguments are parsed. The class template is pseudo-instantiated on a tentative type to validate that the declarations in the class template are correct. Consider this class template:

   ```cpp
   template <typename T> class Derived : public Base<T> { ... }
   ```

   The template declaration, `template <typename T`>, the class head `class Derived`, and the base-class list `public Base<T>` are parsed, but the template body is captured as a token stream.

- When parsing a function template, the compiler parses only the function signature. The function body is never parsed. Instead, it is captured as a token stream. Consequently, if the template body has syntax errors and the template is never instantiated the errors are never diagnosed.

An example of how this behavior causes incorrect parsing can be seen with how the compiler does not require the keywords `template` and `typename` everywhere they C++ Standard requires them. These keywords are needed in some positions to disambiguate how compilers should parse a dependent name during the first phase of lookup. For example:

`T::Foo<a || b>(c);`

Is this code a call to a function template with an argument of `a || b`? Or is this a logical-or expression with `T::foo < a` as the left operand and `b > (c)` as the right operand?

A conforming compiler parses `Foo` as a variable in the scope of `T`, meaning this code is an or operation between two comparisons. If you meant to use `Foo` as a function template, you must indicate that this is a template by adding the `template` keyword:

`T::template Foo<a || b>(c);`

In versions prior to Visual Studio 2017 version 15.3, and when **/Zc:twoPhase-** is specified, the compiler allows this code without the `template` keyword because it parses templates in a very limited fashion. The code above isn't parsed at all in the first phase. During the second phase thereâ€™s enough context to tell that T::Foo is a template rather than a variable so the compiler does not enforce use of the keyword.

For more information about conformance issues in Visual C++, see [Nonstandard Behavior](../../cpp/nonstandard-behavior.md).

### To set this compiler option in the Visual Studio development environment

1. Open the project's **Property Pages** dialog box. For details, see [Working with Project Properties](../../ide/working-with-project-properties.md).

1. Select the **Configuration Properties** > **C/C++** > **Command Line** property page.

1. Modify the **Additional Options** property to include **/Zc:twoPhase-** and then choose **OK**.
