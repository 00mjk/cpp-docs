# Configure Visual C++ for ARM processors

This section of the documentation contains information about how to use the Visual C++ build tools to target ARM hardware.

## In This Section

[Overview of ARM ABI Conventions](overview-of-arm-abi-conventions.md)<br/>
Describes the application binary interface used by Windows on ARM for register usage, calling conventions and exception handling.

[Overview of ARM64 ABI Conventions](arm64-windows-abi-conventions.md)<br/>
Describes the application binary interface used by Windows on ARM64 for register usage, calling conventions and exception handling.

[Common Visual C++ ARM Migration Issues](common-visual-cpp-arm-migration-issues.md)<br/>
Describes C++ code elements that are commonly assumed to be portable across architectures, but which produce different results for ARM than for x86 and x64.

[ARM Exception Handling](arm-exception-handling.md)<br/>
Describes the encoding scheme for stack unwinding during structured exception handling in Windows on ARM.

[ARM64 Exception Handling](arm64-exception-handling.md)<br/>
Describes the encoding scheme for stack unwinding during structured exception handling in Windows on ARM64.
