# Formatting Time: Automation Classes
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Formatting Time: Automation Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/atl-mfc-shared/formatting-time-automation-classes).  
  
  
To format a time  
  
1.  Use the **Format** member function of either [COleDateTime](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetime-class.md) or [COleDateTimeSpan](../atl-mfc-shared/reference/coledatetimespan-class.md) to create a character string representing the time or elapsed time.

 For more information, see class [COleVariant](../mfc/reference/colevariant-class.md).
