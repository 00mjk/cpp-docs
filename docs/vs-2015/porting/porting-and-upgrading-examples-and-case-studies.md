# Porting and Upgrading: Examples and Case Studies
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Porting and Upgrading: Examples and Case Studies](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/porting/porting-and-upgrading-examples-and-case-studies).  
  
  
You can get an idea of the kinds of issues you might encounter duration a migration from a previous version of Visual C++ to the current one by reviewing stories of successful migrations.  
  
## Examples of Successful Migrations  
 Here, you can read about what it took to migrate some modest samples and tools to the latest version of Visual C++. The issues encountered in these migrations are typical of the kinds of issues you might encounter in any migration, but with one important exception, and that is the size of the code. The samples are of course very small and short compared to real-world application code.  
  
-   [MFC Scribble](../porting/porting-guide-mfc-scribble.md) is a sample  that uses the basics of MFC.  
  
-   [COM Spy](../porting/porting-guide-mfc-scribble.md) is an application that displays information about COM+ components on a machine.  
  
-   [Spy++](../porting/porting-guide-spy-increment.md) is an application that inspects and provides information about UI elements in running applications.
