# 2. Directives
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

Directives are based on **#pragma** directives defined in the C and C++ standards.  Compilers that support the OpenMP C and C++ API will include a command-line option that activates and allows interpretation of all OpenMP compiler directives.
