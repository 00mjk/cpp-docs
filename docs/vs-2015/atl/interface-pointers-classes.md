# Interface Pointers Classes
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Interface Pointers Classes (ATL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/atl/interface-pointers-classes).  
  
  
The following classes manage a given interface pointer:  
  
-   [CComPtr](../atl/reference/ccomptr-class.md) Performs automatic reference counting.  
  
-   [CComQIPtr](../atl/reference/ccomqiptr-class.md) Similar to `CComPtr`, but also performs automatic querying of interfaces.  
  
-   [CInterfaceArray](../atl/reference/cinterfacearray-class.md) Provides methods useful when constructing an array of COM interface pointers.  
  
-   [CInterfaceList](../atl/reference/cinterfacelist-class.md) Provides methods useful when constructing a list of COM interface pointers.  
  
-   [CComGITPtr](../atl/reference/ccomgitptr-class.md) Provides methods for dealing with interface pointers and the global interface table (GIT).
