# Building and Testing the ATL Project
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Building and Testing the ATL Project](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/atl/building-and-testing-the-atl-project).  
  
  
As mentioned in [Inserting a Composite Control](../atl/inserting-a-composite-control.md), one of the initial components of the project is a default HTML page that hosts your new composite control. After you finish modifying the composite control, click **Build Solution** or **Rebuild Solution** from the **Build** menu. Once the project successfully builds, load the HTML page, located in the root directory of your composite control project, into Internet Explorer or another browser and test the functionality of your control.  
  
 You can also test your composite control using the Test Container tool, or any other application that can host an ActiveX control. See [Testing Properties and Events with Test Container](../mfc/testing-properties-and-events-with-test-container.md) for information on how to access the test container.
