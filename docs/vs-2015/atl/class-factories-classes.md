-   [CComClassFactory2](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactory2-class.md) Controls object creation through a license.  
  
-   [CComClassFactoryAutoThread](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactoryautothread-class.md) Allows objects to be created in multiple thread-pooled apartments.  
  
-   [CComClassFactorySingleton](../atl/reference/ccomclassfactorysingleton-class.md) Creates a single object.  
  
-   [CComCoClass](../atl/reference/ccomcoclass-class.md) Defines the class factory for the object.
