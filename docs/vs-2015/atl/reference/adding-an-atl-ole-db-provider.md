# Adding an ATL OLE DB Provider
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Adding an ATL OLE DB Provider](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/atl/reference/adding-an-atl-ole-db-provider).  
  
  
Use this wizard to add an ATL OLE DB provider to a project. An ATL OLE DB provider consists of a data source, session, command, and rowset classes. The project must have been created as an ATL COM application.  
  
### To add an ATL OLE DB provider to your project  
  
1.  In Class View, right-click the project. On the shortcut menu, click **Add** and then click **Add Class**.  
  
2.  In the Visual C++ folder, double-click the **ATL OLE DB Provider** icon or select it and click **Open**.  
  
     The ATL OLE DB Provider Wizard opens.  
  
3.  Define settings as described in [ATL OLE DB Provider Wizard](../../atl/reference/atl-ole-db-provider-wizard.md).  
  
4.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard, which will insert the newly created OLE DB provider code in your project.
