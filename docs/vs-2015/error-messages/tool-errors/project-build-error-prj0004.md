# Project Build Error PRJ0004
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Project Build Error PRJ0004](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/error-messages/tool-errors/project-build-error-prj0004).  
  
  
Could not generate command line for the 'tool' tool.  
  
 One or more properties were specified in such a way as to make the syntax of the call to ***tool*** illegal:  
  
-   You may have specified badly formed or unknown macros.  
  
-   Your computer may be low on free disk space.  
  
 You may want to review the settings for the tool by looking at the [Command Line property page](../../ide/command-line-property-pages.md).
