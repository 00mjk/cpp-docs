# Fatal Error C1210
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Fatal Error C1210](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/fatal-error-c1210).  
  
  
clr:pure and /clr:safe are not supported by the version of the runtime installed  
  
 C1210 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.  
  
 Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.  
  
 To resolve C1210 install the common language runtime version that is intended for use with your compiler.
