# Fatal Error C1209
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Fatal Error C1209](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/fatal-error-c1209).  
  
  
Friend assemblies not supported by the version of the runtime installed  
  
 C1208 occurs when you have a compiler for the current release, but a common language runtime from a previous release.  
  
 Some functionality of the compiler may not work on a previous version of the run time.  
  
 To resolve C1209, install the common language runtime that shipped with the compiler you are using.  
  
 For more information, see [Friend Assemblies (C++)](../../dotnet/friend-assemblies-cpp.md).
