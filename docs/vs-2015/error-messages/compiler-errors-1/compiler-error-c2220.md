# Compiler Error C2220
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Compiler Error C2220](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/error-messages/compiler-errors-1/compiler-error-c2220).  
  
  
warning treated as error - no object file generated  
  
 [/WX](../../build/reference/compiler-option-warning-level.md) tells the compiler to treat all warnings as errors. Because an error occurred, no object or executable file was generated.  
  
 This error only appears when the **/WX** flag is set and a warning occurs during compilation. To fix this error, you must eliminate every warning in your project.  
  
### To fix, use one of the following techniques  
  
-   Fix the problems that cause warnings in your project.  
  
-   Compile at a lower warning levelâ€”for example, use **/W3** instead of **/W4**.  
  
-   Use a [warning](../../preprocessor/warning.md) pragma to disable or suppress a specific warning.  
  
-   Don't use **/WX** to compile.
