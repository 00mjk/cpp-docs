[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Compiler Warning (level 4) C4517](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/error-messages/compiler-warnings/compiler-warning-level-4-c4517).  
  
  
access-declarations are deprecated; member using-declarations provide a better alternative  
  
 The ANSI C++ committee has declared access declarations (changing the access of a member in a derived class without the [using](../../cpp/using-declaration.md) keyword) to be outdated. Access declarations may not be supported by future versions of C++.
