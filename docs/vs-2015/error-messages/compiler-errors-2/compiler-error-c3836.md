# Compiler Error C3836
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

static constructor is not allowed to have a member initializer list  
  
 A managed class cannot have a static constructor that also has a member initialization list. Static class constructors are called by the common language runtime to do class initialization, initializing static data members.  
  
 The following sample generates C3836:  
  
```  
// C3836a.cpp  
// compile with: /clr  
ref class M  
{  
   static int s_i;  
  
public:  
   static M() :  s_i(1234)   // C3836, delete initializer to resolve  
   {  
   }  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
}  
```  
  
 The following sample generates C3836:  
  
```  
// C3836b.cpp  
// compile with: /clr:oldSyntax  
#using <mscorlib.dll>  
  
__gc class M  
{  
   static int s_i;  
  
public:  
   static M() :  s_i(1234)   // C3836, delete initializer to resolve  
   {  
   }  
};  
  
int main()  
{  
}  
```
