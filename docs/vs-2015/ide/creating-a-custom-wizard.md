# Creating a Custom Wizard
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Creating a Custom Wizard](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/ide/creating-a-custom-wizard).  
  
  
The Visual C++ Custom Wizard is the tool to use when you need to create a new custom wizard. The easiest way to create a custom wizard is to use the [Custom Wizard](../ide/custom-wizard.md).  
  
> [!TIP]
>  The Custom Wizard template is not available in Express editions.  
  
### To create a wizard using the Custom Wizard  
  
1.  Follow the instructions in the help topic [Creating a Project with a Visual C++ Application Wizard](../ide/creating-desktop-projects-by-using-application-wizards.md).  
  
2.  In the **New Project** dialog box, select the **Custom Wizard** icon in the **Visual C++ &#124; General** templates pane to open the Custom Wizard.  
  
3.  Define your [application settings](../ide/application-settings-custom-wizard.md) using the Custom Wizard.  
  
4.  Click **Finish** to close the wizard and open your new project in the development environment.  
  
 After you have created your project, you can view the files created in **Solution Explorer**. For more information about the files created for the Custom Wizard, see [Files Created for Your Wizard](../ide/files-created-for-your-wizard.md).
