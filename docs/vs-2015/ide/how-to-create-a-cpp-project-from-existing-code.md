# How to: Create a C++ Project from Existing Code
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [How to: Create a C++ Project from Existing Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/ide/how-to-create-a-cpp-project-from-existing-code).  
  
  
In [!INCLUDE[vsPro](../includes/vspro-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[vsUltShort](../includes/vsultshort-md.md)] you can port your existing code files into a Visual C++ project using the **Create New Project From Existing Code Files** wizard. This wizard is not available in Express editions.  
  
 Porting your existing code files into a Visual C++ project enables you to use IDE features such as [IntelliSense](../Topic/Using%20IntelliSense.md), **Call Browser**, and [Property Manager](../misc/property-manager.md).  
  
### To create a C++ project from existing code  
  
1.  On the **File** menu, point to **New**, and then click **Project From Existing Code**.  
  
2.  On the first page of the **Create New Project from Existing Code Files** wizard, select **Visual C++** in the **What type of project would you like to create** list.  
  
3.  In subsequent pages of the wizard, specify settings for the new project that you want to create.  
  
4.  Click **Finish** to generate the new project.
