# Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/ide/using-the-visual-studio-ide-for-cpp-desktop-development).  
  
  
The [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] Integrated Development Environment (IDE) offers a set of tools that help you write and modify code, and also detect and correct errors.  
  
 In the articles in this section of the documentation, you create a standard C++ program and test its functionality by using features in [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../includes/vsprvs-md.md)]. The basic program that you create tracks how many players are playing different card games.  
  
 Here are the articles:  
  
-   [Walkthrough: Working with Projects and Solutions (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-working-with-projects-and-solutions-cpp.md)  
  
-   [Walkthrough: Building a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-building-a-project-cpp.md)  
  
-   [Walkthrough: Testing a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-testing-a-project-cpp.md)  
  
-   [Walkthrough: Debugging a Project (C++)](../ide/walkthrough-debugging-a-project-cpp.md)
