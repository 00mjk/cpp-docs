# Adding a Method  (Visual C++)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Adding a Method  (Visual C++)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/ide/adding-a-method-visual-cpp).  
  
  
You can use the [Add Method Wizard](../ide/add-method-wizard.md) to add a method to an interface in your project. If the project contains a class associated with the interface, the wizard modifies the class, too.  
  
### To add a method to your object  
  
1.  In Class View, expand the project node to display the interface to which you want to add the method.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  You can also add methods to dispinterfaces, which, unless the project is attributed, are located under the library node.  
  
2.  Right-click the name of the interface.  
  
3.  On the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Method**.  
  
4.  In the Add Method Wizard, provide the information to create the method.  
  
5.  Specify any interface definition language settings for this method in the [IDL attributes](../ide/idl-attributes-add-method-wizard.md) page of the wizard.  
  
6.  Click **Finish** to add the method.
