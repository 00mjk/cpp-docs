# Numerical Limits (C++)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Numerical Limits (C++)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/numerical-limits-cpp).  
  
The two standard include files, LIMITS.H and FLOAT.H, define the numerical limits, or minimum and maximum values that a variable of a given type can hold. These minimums and maximums are guaranteed to be portable to any C++ compiler that uses the same data representation as ANSI C. The LIMITS.H include file defines the [numerical limits for integral types](../cpp/integer-limits.md), and FLOAT.H defines the [numerical limits for floating types](../cpp/floating-limits.md).
