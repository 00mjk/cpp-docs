# Additional Termination Considerations
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Additional Termination Considerations](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/additional-termination-considerations).  
  
You can terminate a C++ program by using **exit**, `return`, or **abort**. You can add exit processing using the `atexit` function. These are discussed in the following sections.
