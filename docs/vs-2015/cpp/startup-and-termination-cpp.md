# Startup and Termination (C++)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Startup and Termination (C++)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/startup-and-termination-cpp).  
  
Program startup and termination are facilitated by using two functions: [main](../cpp/main-program-startup.md) and [exit](../cpp/program-termination.md). Other startup and termination code may be executed.
