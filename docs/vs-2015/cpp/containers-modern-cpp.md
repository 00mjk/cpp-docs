# Containers (Modern C++)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Containers (Modern C++)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/containers-modern-cpp).  
  
By default, use [vector](../standard-library/vector-class.md) as the preferred sequential container in C++. This is the equivalent of List\<T> in .NET languages.  
  
```cpp  
vector<string> apples;  
apples.push_back("Granny Smith");  
```  
  
 Use [map](../standard-library/map-class.md) (not `unordered_map`) as the default associative container. Use [set](../standard-library/set-class.md), [multimap](../standard-library/multimap-class.md), [multiset](../standard-library/multiset-class.md) for degenerate & multi cases.  
  
```cpp  
map<string, string> apple_color;  
// ...  
apple_color["Granny Smith"] = "Green";  
```  
  
1.  the array type when embedding is important - for example, as a class member.  
  
2.  unordered associative containers (unordered_map, et al.): Lower per-element overhead (major) and constant-time lookup (potentially major, sometimes minor). Harder to use correctly and efficiently, because of inconveniences and sharp edges.  
  
3.  sorted vector. (See: [Algorithms](../cpp/algorithms-modern-cpp.md).)  
  
 Donâ€™t use C-style arrays. For older APIs that need direct access to the data, use `f( vec.data(), vec.size() );` instead.  
  
 For more information about containers, see [C++ Standard Library Containers](../standard-library/stl-containers.md).
