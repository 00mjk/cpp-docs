# Program and Linkage  (C++)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Program and Linkage  (C++)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/program-and-linkage-cpp).  
  
A program consists of one or more translation units linked together. Execution (conceptually) begins in the translation unit that contains the function **main**. (For more information on translation units, see [Phases of Translation](../preprocessor/phases-of-translation.md), in the *Preprocessor Reference*.) For more information about the **main** function, see [Program Startup: the main Function](../cpp/main-program-startup.md).)
