# Ordering of C++ Arrays
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Ordering of C++ Arrays](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/ordering-of-cpp-arrays).  
  
C++ arrays are stored in row-major order. Row-major order means the last subscript varies the fastest.
