# Program Termination
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Program Termination](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/program-termination).  
  
In C++, there are several ways to exit a program:  
  
-   Call the [exit](../cpp/exit-function.md) function.  
  
-   Call the [abort](../cpp/abort-function.md) function.  
  
-   Execute a [return](../cpp/return-statement-in-program-termination-cpp.md) statement from **main**.
