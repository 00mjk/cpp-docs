# Indirection on Array Types
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Indirection on Array Types](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/cpp/indirection-on-array-types).  
  
Use of the indirection operator (**\***) on an *n*-dimensional array type yields an *n*â€“1 dimensional array. If *n* is 1, a scalar (or array element) is yielded.
