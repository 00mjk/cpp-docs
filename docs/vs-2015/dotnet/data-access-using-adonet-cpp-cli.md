# Data Access Using ADO.NET (C++/CLI)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Data Access Using ADO.NET (C++/CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/dotnet/data-access-using-adonet-cpp-cli).  
  
  
ADO.NET is the .NET Framework API for data access and provides power and ease of use unmatched by previous data access solutions. This section describes some of the issues involving ADO.NET that are unique to Visual C++ users, such as marshaling native types.  
  
 ADO.NET runs under the Common Language Runtime (CLR). Therefore, any application that interacts with ADO.NET must also target the CLR. However, that does not mean that native applications cannot use ADO.NET. These examples will demonstrate how to interact with an ADO.NET database from native code.
