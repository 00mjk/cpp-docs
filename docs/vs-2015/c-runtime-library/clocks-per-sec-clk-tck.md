# CLOCKS_PER_SEC, CLK_TCK
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [CLOCKS_PER_SEC, CLK_TCK](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/clocks-per-sec-clk-tck).  
  
Syntax  
  
```  
  
#include <time.h>  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 The time in seconds is the value returned by the `clock` function, divided by `CLOCKS_PER_SEC`. `CLK_TCK` is equivalent, but considered obsolete.
