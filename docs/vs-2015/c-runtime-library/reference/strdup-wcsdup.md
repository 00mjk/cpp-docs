The latest version of this topic can be found at [strdup, wcsdup](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/reference/strdup-wcsdup).  
  
These POSIX functions are deprecated. Use the ISO C++ conformant [_strdup, _wcsdup, _mbsdup](../../c-runtime-library/reference/strdup-wcsdup-mbsdup.md) instead.
