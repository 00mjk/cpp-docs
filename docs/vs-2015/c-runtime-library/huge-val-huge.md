# HUGE_VAL, _HUGE
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [HUGE_VAL, _HUGE](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/huge-val-huge).  
  
Syntax  
  
```  
  
#include <math.h>  
  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 `HUGE_VAL` is the largest representable double value. This value is returned by many run-time math functions when an error occurs. For some functions, â€“`HUGE_VAL` is returned. `HUGE_VAL` is defined as `_HUGE`, but run-time math functions return `HUGE_VAL`. You should also use `HUGE_VAL` in your code for consistency.
