# Windows Platforms (CRT)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Windows Platforms (CRT)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/windows-platforms-crt).  
  
The C run-time libraries for [!INCLUDE[vs2012_upd01](../includes/vs2012-upd01-md.md)] support [!INCLUDE[win8](../includes/win8-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winserver8](../includes/winserver8-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[win7](../includes/win7-md.md)], [!INCLUDE[winsvr08](../includes/winsvr08-md.md)], Windows Vista, [!INCLUDE[winxp](../includes/winxp-md.md)] Service Pack 3 (SP3) for x86, [!INCLUDE[winxp](../includes/winxp-md.md)] Service Pack 2 (SP2) for x64, and [!INCLUDE[WinXPSvr](../includes/winxpsvr-md.md)] Service Pack 2 (SP2) for both x86 and x64. All of these operating systems support the Windows Application Programming Interface (API) and provide Unicode support. In addition, any Win32 application can use a multibyte character set (MBCS).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  [!INCLUDE[vs_dev11_long](../includes/vs-dev11-long-md.md)] does not support [!INCLUDE[winxp](../includes/winxp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[WinXPSvr](../includes/winxpsvr-md.md)] development. You must install [!INCLUDE[vs2012_upd01](../includes/vs2012-upd01-md.md)] to add support for [!INCLUDE[winxp](../includes/winxp-md.md)] and [!INCLUDE[WinXPSvr](../includes/winxpsvr-md.md)].
