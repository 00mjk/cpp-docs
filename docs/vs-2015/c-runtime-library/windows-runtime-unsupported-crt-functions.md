# Windows Runtime Unsupported CRT Functions
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Windows Runtime Unsupported CRT Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-runtime-library/windows-runtime-unsupported-crt-functions).  
  
Many C run-time (CRT) APIs canâ€™t be used in [!INCLUDE[win8_appname_long](../includes/win8-appname-long-md.md)] apps that execute in the [!INCLUDE[wrt](../includes/wrt-md.md)]. These apps are built by using the /ZW compiler flag. For a list of unsupported CRT functions, see [CRT functions not supported by /ZW](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/apps/jj606124.aspx).  
  
 All CRT APIs are described in the [Alphabetical Function Reference](../c-runtime-library/reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference.md) section of the documentation.
