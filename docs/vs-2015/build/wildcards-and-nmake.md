# Wildcards and NMAKE
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Wildcards and NMAKE](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/wildcards-and-nmake).  
  
  
NMAKE expands filename wildcards (* and ?) in dependency lines. A wildcard specified in a command is passed to the command; NMAKE does not expand it.
