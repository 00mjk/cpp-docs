# Non-MFC DLLs: Overview
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Non-MFC DLLs: Overview](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/non-mfc-dlls-overview).  
  
  
A non-MFC DLL is a DLL that does not use MFC internally, and the exported functions in the DLL can be called by either MFC or non-MFC executable files. Functions are usually exported from a non-MFC DLL using the standard C interface.  
  
 For more information about non-MFC DLLs, see [Dynamic-Link Libraries](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms682589) in the [!INCLUDE[winsdkshort](../includes/winsdkshort-md.md)].
