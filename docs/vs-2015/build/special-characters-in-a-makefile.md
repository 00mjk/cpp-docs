# Special Characters in a Makefile
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Special Characters in a Makefile](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/special-characters-in-a-makefile).  
  
  
To use an NMAKE special character as a literal character, place a caret (^) in front of it. NMAKE ignores carets that precede other characters. The special characters are:  
  
 `:  ;  #  (  )  $  ^  \  {  }  !  @  â€”`  
  
 A caret (^) within a quoted string is treated as a literal caret character. A caret at the end of a line inserts a literal newline character in a string or macro.  
  
 In macros, a backslash (\\) followed by a newline character is replaced by a space.  
  
 In commands, a percent symbol (%) is a file specifier. To represent % literally in a command, specify a double percent sign (%%) in place of a single one. In other situations, NMAKE interprets a single % literally, but it always interprets a double %% as a single %. Therefore, to represent a literal %%, specify either three percent signs, %%%, or four percent signs, %%%%.  
  
 To use the dollar sign ($) as a literal character in a command, specify two dollar signs ($$). This method can also be used in other situations where ^$ works.
