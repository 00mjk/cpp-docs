# Structure of a Library
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Structure of a Library](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/structure-of-a-library).  
  
  
A library contains COFF objects. Objects in a library contain functions and data that can be referenced externally by other objects in a program. An object in a library is sometimes referred to as a library member.  
  
 You can get additional information about the contents of a library by running the DUMPBIN tool with the /LINKERMEMBER option. For more information about this option, see [DUMPBIN Reference](../../build/reference/dumpbin-reference.md).
