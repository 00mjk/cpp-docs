# Fixing Release Build Problems
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Fixing Release Build Problems](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/fixing-release-build-problems).  
  
  
If your code generates compile errors after switching from debug build to release build, there are some areas you should check.  
  
 You may receive compiler warnings during an optimized (release) build that you did not receive during a debug build.  
  
-   [Examine ASSERT Statements](../../build/reference/using-verify-instead-of-assert.md)  
  
-   [Use the Debug Build To Check for Memory Overwrites](../../build/reference/using-the-debug-build-to-check-for-memory-overwrite.md)  
  
-   [Turn on Generation of Debug Information for the Release Build](../../build/reference/how-to-debug-a-release-build.md)  
  
-   [Check for Memory Overwrite](../../build/reference/checking-for-memory-overwrites.md)
