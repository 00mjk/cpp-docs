# Building a .Bsc File
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Building a .Bsc File](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/building-a-dot-bsc-file).  
  
  
BSCMAKE can build a new browse information file from newly created .sbr files. It can also maintain an existing .bsc file using .sbr files for object files that have changed since the last build.
