# Other LIB Output
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Other LIB Output](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/other-lib-output).  
  
  
In the default mode, you can use the /LIST option to display information about the resulting library. You can redirect this output to a file.  
  
 LIB displays a copyright and version message and echoes command files unless the /NOLOGO option is used.  
  
 When you type `lib` with no other input, LIB displays a usage statement that summarizes its options.  
  
 Error and warning messages issued by LIB have the form LNK*nnnn*. The LINK, DUMPBIN, and EDITBIN tools also use this range of errors. Help is available by selecting the error in the Output window and pressing F1.
