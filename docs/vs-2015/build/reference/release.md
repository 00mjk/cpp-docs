# /RELEASE
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [-RELEASE](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/release).  
  
  
RELEASE  
```  
  
## Remarks  
 This option sets the checksum in the header of an executable file.  
  
 The operating system requires the checksum for device drivers. It is recommended that you set the checksum for release versions of your device drivers to ensure compatibility with future operating systems.
