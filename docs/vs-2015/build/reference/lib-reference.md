# LIB Reference
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [LIB Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/reference/lib-reference).  
  
  
The Microsoft Library Manager (LIB.exe) creates and manages a library of Common Object File Format (COFF) object files. LIB can also be used to create export files and import libraries to reference exported definitions.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  You can start this tool only from the [!INCLUDE[vsprvs](../../includes/vsprvs-md.md)] command prompt. You cannot start it from a system command prompt or from File Explorer.
