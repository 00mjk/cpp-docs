# Special NMAKE Macros
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Special NMAKE Macros](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/special-nmake-macros).  
  
  
NMAKE provides several special macros to represent various filenames and commands. One use for some of these macros is in the predefined inference rules. Like all macros, the macros provided by NMAKE are case sensitive.

-   [Command macros and options macros](../build/command-macros-and-options-macros.md)
