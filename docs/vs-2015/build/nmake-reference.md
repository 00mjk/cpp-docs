# NMAKE Reference
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [NMAKE Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/nmake-reference).  
  
  
The Microsoft Program Maintenance Utility (NMAKE.EXE) is a command-line tool that builds projects based on commands that are contained in a description file.  

 NMAKE is included when you install Visual Studio or the Visual C++ command-line build tools. It's not available separately. To download and install Visual Studio, see [VisualStudio.com](https://www.visualstudio.com/). To install only the command-line tools, download and install [Microsoft Visual C++ Build Tools](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=691126). Both installations include 64-bit and 32-bit native command-line tools that target x64, x86, and ARM.
  
 To use NMAKE, you must run it in a command prompt window that has the required paths and environment variables set for the Visual C++ build tools, libraries, and include files. The easiest way to do this is to run it in a developer command prompt window. For details on how to open a developer command prompt window, see [Building on the Command Line](../build/building-on-the-command-line.md). If you'd rather customize your own command prompt window, or if you want to use the x64-hosted compilers or build for x64 or ARM targets, see [Setting the Path and Environment Variables for Command-Line Builds](../build/setting-the-path-and-environment-variables-for-command-line-builds.md).
