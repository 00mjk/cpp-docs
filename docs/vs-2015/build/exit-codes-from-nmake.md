[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Exit Codes from NMAKE](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/build/exit-codes-from-nmake).

|Code|Meaning|  
|----------|-------------|  
|0|No error (possibly a warning)|  
|1|Incomplete build (issued only when /K is used)|  
|2|Program error, possibly due to one of the following:|  
||-   A syntax error in the makefile|  
||-   An error or exit code from a command|  
||-   An interruption by the user|  
|4|System error â€” out of memory|  
|255|Target is not up-to-date (issued only when /Q is used)|
