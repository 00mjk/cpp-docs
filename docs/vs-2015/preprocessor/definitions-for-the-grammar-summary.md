# Definitions for the Grammar Summary
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Definitions for the Grammar Summary](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/preprocessor/definitions-for-the-grammar-summary).  
  
Terminals are endpoints in a syntax definition. No other resolution is possible. Terminals include the set of reserved words and user-defined identifiers.  
  
 Nonterminals are placeholders in the syntax. Most are defined elsewhere in this syntax summary. Definitions can be recursive. The following nonterminals are defined in the [Grammar Summary](../misc/grammar-summary-cpp.md) of the *C++ Language Reference*:  
  
 `constant`, *constant-expression*, *identifier*, *keyword*, `operator`, `punctuator`  
  
 An optional component is indicated by the subscripted opt. For example, the following indicates an optional expression enclosed in curly braces:  
  
 **{** *expression*opt **}**
