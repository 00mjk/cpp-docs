# Conventions
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/preprocessor/conventions).  
  
The conventions use different font attributes for different components of the syntax. The symbols and fonts are as follows:  
  
|Attribute|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|*nonterminal*|Italic type indicates nonterminals.|  
|#include|Terminals in bold type are literal reserved words and symbols that must be entered as shown. Characters in this context are always case sensitive.|  
|opt|Nonterminals followed by opt are always optional.|  
|default typeface|Characters in the set described or listed in this typeface can be used as terminals in statements.|  
  
 A colon (:) following a nonterminal introduces its definition. Alternative definitions are listed on separate lines.
