|-----------|-----------------|  
|[operator new](../c-runtime-library/operator-new-crt.md)|Allocates a block of memory from the heap.|  
|[operator new](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/2476d0f9-59df-485c-981e-ba9f7ee83507)|The function that's called by a new-expression to allocate storage for individual objects.|  
|[new Operator](../cpp/new-operator-cpp.md)|Allocates memory for an object or array of objects from the free store and returns a suitably typed, nonzero pointer to the object.|  
|[new (new slot in vtable)](../windows/new-new-slot-in-vtable-cpp-component-extensions.md)|In a C++/CLI project, indicates that a virtual member gets a new slot in the vtable. In other words, the function does not override a base class method.|  
|[ref new, gcnew](../windows/ref-new-gcnew-cpp-component-extensions.md)|In a [!INCLUDE[cppwrt_short](../includes/cppwrt-short-md.md)] (`ref new`) or C++/CLI (`gcnew`) project, this compound keyword creates a reference-counted object.|
