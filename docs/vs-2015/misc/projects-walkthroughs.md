# Projects Walkthroughs
Visual Studio projects are the containers that developers use to organize source code files and other assets. Projects let you organize, build, debug, and deploy source code and create references to Web services, databases, and other resources. You can view projects and their contents by using **Solution Explorer**.  
  
 The walkthroughs in this section teach how to create and extend Visual Studio projects. For more information about Visual Studio projects and what they can do, see [Extending Projects](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/096d273d-4fe9-4f24-9b00-470bfbdf4bdf).
