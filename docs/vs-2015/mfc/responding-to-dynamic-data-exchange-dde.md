[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Responding to Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/responding-to-dynamic-data-exchange-dde).  
  
  
The frame window can respond to dynamic data exchange (DDE) requests to open files from the File Manager (if the file extension is registered or associated with the application). See [Shell Registration](../mfc/special-cwinapp-services.md).
