# Making and Using Controls
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Making and Using Controls](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/making-and-using-controls).  
  
  
You make most controls for dialog boxes in the Visual C++ [dialog editor](../mfc/dialog-editor.md). But you can also create controls in any dialog box or window.
