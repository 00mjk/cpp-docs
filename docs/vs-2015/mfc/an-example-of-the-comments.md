# An Example of the Comments
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [An Example of the Comments](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/an-example-of-the-comments).  
  
  
The following partial listing of class `CChildFrame` uses most of the standard comments that MFC employs in its classes to divide class members by the ways they are used:  
  
 [!code-cpp[NVC_MFCListView#5](../snippets/cpp/VS_Snippets_Cpp/NVC_MFCListView/Cpp/ChildFrm.h#5)]  
  
 These comments consistently mark sections of the class declaration that contain similar kinds of class members. Keep in mind that these are MFC conventions, not set rules.
