To copy a device image  
  
1.  On the **Image** menu, click **Open Device Image** and select an image from the current images list. For example, choose the 32 × 32, 16-color version of an icon.  
  
2.  Copy the currently displayed icon image (**CTRL+C**).  
  
3.  Open a different image of the icon in another **Image Editor** window. For example, open the 16 × 16, 16-color version of the icon.  
  
4.  Paste the icon image (**CTRL+V**) from one **Image Editor** window to the other. If you are pasting a larger size into a smaller size, you can use the icon handles to resize the image.
