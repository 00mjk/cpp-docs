# Windows Sockets
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Windows Sockets](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/windows-sockets).  
  
  
This family of articles covers the MFC implementation of Windows Sockets. MFC supplies two classes to support programming network applications with the Windows Sockets API. Class [CAsyncSocket](../mfc/reference/casyncsocket-class.md) encapsulates the Windows Sockets API one for one, giving advanced network programmers the most power and flexibility. Class [CSocket](../mfc/reference/csocket-class.md) provides a simplified interface for serializing data to and from a [CArchive](../mfc/reference/carchive-class.md) object.
