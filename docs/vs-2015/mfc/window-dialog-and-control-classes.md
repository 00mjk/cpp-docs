# Window, Dialog, and Control Classes
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Window, Dialog, and Control Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/window-dialog-and-control-classes).  
  
  
Class `CWnd` and its derived classes encapsulate an `HWND`, a handle to a Windows window. `CWnd` can be used by itself or as a base for deriving new classes. The derived classes supplied by the class library represent various kinds of windows.  
  
 [CWnd](../mfc/reference/cwnd-class.md)  
 The base class for all windows. You can use one of the classes derived from `CWnd` or derive your own classes directly from it.
