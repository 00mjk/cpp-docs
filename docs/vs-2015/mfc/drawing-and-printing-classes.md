# Drawing and Printing Classes
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Drawing and Printing Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/drawing-and-printing-classes).  
  
  
In Windows, all graphical output is drawn on a virtual drawing area called a device context (DC). MFC provides classes to encapsulate the various types of DCs, as well as encapsulations for Windows drawing tools such as bitmaps, brushes, palettes, and pens.
