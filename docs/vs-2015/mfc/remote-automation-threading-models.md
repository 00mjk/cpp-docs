# Remote Automation Threading Models
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Remote Automation Threading Models](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/remote-automation-threading-models).  
  
  
Remote Automation supports both the single-threaded and the apartment-threaded models of COM. On 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, which are all that Visual C++ supports, the threading model should be set to "apartment." For more information on how and where to do this, see [Creating Programs That Use Remote Automation](../mfc/creating-programs-that-use-remote-automation.md).
