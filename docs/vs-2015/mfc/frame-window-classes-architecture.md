# Frame Window Classes (Architecture)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Frame Window Classes (Architecture)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/frame-window-classes-architecture).  
  
  
In document/view architecture, frame windows are windows that contain a view window. They also support having control bars attached to them.  
  
 In multiple document interface (MDI) applications, the main window is derived from `CMDIFrameWnd`. It indirectly contains the documents' frames, which are `CMDIChildWnd` objects. The `CMDIChildWnd` objects, in turn, contain the documents' views.  
  
 In single document interface (SDI) applications, the main window, derived from `CFrameWnd`, contains the view of the current document.  
  
 [CFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cframewnd-class.md)  
 The base class for an SDI application's main frame window. Also the base class for all other frame window classes.  
  
 [CMDIFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdiframewnd-class.md)  
 The base class for an MDI application's main frame window.  
  
 [CMDIChildWnd](../mfc/reference/cmdichildwnd-class.md)  
 The base class for an MDI application's document frame windows.  
  
 [COleIPFrameWnd](../mfc/reference/coleipframewnd-class.md)  
 Provides the frame window for a view when a server document is being edited in place.
