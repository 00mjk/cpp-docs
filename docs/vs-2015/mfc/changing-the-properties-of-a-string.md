# Changing the Properties of a String
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Changing the Properties of a String](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/changing-the-properties-of-a-string).  
 
  
To change a string or its identifier  
  
1.  Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md).  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  Select the string you want to edit, and double-click the **ID**, **Value**, or **Caption** column. Now you can:  
  
    -   Select an **ID** from the **ID drop-down** list, or type an ID directly in place.  
  
    -   Type a different number in the **Value** column.  
  
    -   Type edits in the **Caption** column.  
  
        > [!NOTE]
        >  You can also edit a string's properties in the [Properties window](../Topic/Properties%20Window.md).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects (those that target the common language runtime), please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).
