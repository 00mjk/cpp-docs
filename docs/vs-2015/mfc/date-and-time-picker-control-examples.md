# Date and Time Picker Control Examples
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Date and Time Picker Control Examples](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/date-and-time-picker-control-examples).  
  
  
The [CMNCTRL1](../top/visual-cpp-samples.md) sample demonstrates the various attributes of the `CDateTimeCtrl` class. A separate page contains a date and time picker control that the user can manipulate by changing various attributes and testing the basic functionality of the control.
