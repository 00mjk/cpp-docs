The latest version of this topic can be found at [Debugging Support Classes](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/debugging-support-classes).  
  
  
MFC provides the following classes to help you debug dynamic memory allocation problems.  
  
 [CDumpContext](../mfc/reference/cdumpcontext-class.md)  
 Provides a destination for diagnostic dumps.  
  
 [CMemoryState](../mfc/reference/cmemorystate-structure.md)
