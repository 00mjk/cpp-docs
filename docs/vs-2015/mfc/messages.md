# Messages
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Messages](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/messages).  
  
  
The message loop in the **Run** member function of class `CWinApp` retrieves queued messages generated by various events. For example, when the user clicks the mouse, Windows sends several mouse-related messages, such as `WM_LBUTTONDOWN` when the left mouse button is pressed and `WM_LBUTTONUP` when the left mouse button is released. The framework's implementation of the application message loop dispatches the message to the appropriate window.  
  
 The important categories of messages are described in [Message Categories](../mfc/message-categories.md).
