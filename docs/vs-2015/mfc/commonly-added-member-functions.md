# Commonly Added Member Functions
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Commonly Added Member Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/commonly-added-member-functions).  
  
  
If your dialog box contains pushbuttons other than OK or Cancel, you need to write message-handler member functions in your dialog class to respond to the control-notification messages they generate. For an example, see the [Scribble](../top/visual-cpp-samples.md) sample program. You can also handle control-notification messages from other controls in your dialog box.
