# Creating a New Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Creating a New Dialog Box](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/creating-a-new-dialog-box).  
  
  
To create a new dialog box  
  
1.  In [Resource View](../windows/resource-view-window.md), right-click your .rc file, then choose **Add Resource** from the shortcut menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../windows/how-to-create-a-resource-script-file.md).  
  
2.  In the **Add Resource** dialog box, select **Dialog** in the **Resource Type** list, then click **New**.  
  
     If a plus sign (+) appears next to the Dialog resource type, it means that dialog box templates are available. Click the plus sign to expand the list of templates, select a template, and click New.  
  
     The new dialog box opens in the Dialog editor.  
  
     You can also [open existing dialog boxes in the Dialog Box editor for editing](../mfc/viewing-and-editing-resources-in-a-resource-editor.md).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).
