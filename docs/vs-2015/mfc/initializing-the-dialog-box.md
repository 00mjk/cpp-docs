# Initializing the Dialog Box
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Initializing the Dialog Box](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/mfc/initializing-the-dialog-box).  
  
  
After the dialog box and all of its controls are created but just before the dialog box (of either type) appears on the screen, the dialog object's [OnInitDialog](../mfc/reference/cdialog-class.md#oninitdialog) member function is called. For a modal dialog box, this occurs during the `DoModal` call. For a modeless dialog box, `OnInitDialog` is called when **Create** is called. You typically override `OnInitDialog` to initialize the dialog box's controls, such as setting the initial text of an edit box. You must call the `OnInitDialog` member function of the base class, `CDialog`, from your `OnInitDialog` override.  
  
 If you want to set your dialog box's background color (and that of all other dialog boxes in your application), see [Setting the Dialog Box's Background Color](../mfc/setting-the-dialog-boxâ€™s-background-color.md).
