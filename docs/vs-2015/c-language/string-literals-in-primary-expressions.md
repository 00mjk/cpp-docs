# String Literals in Primary Expressions
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [String Literals in Primary Expressions](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/string-literals-in-primary-expressions).  
  
A "string literal" is a character, wide character, or sequence of adjacent characters enclosed in double quotation marks. Since they are not variables, neither string literals nor any of their elements can be the left-hand operand in an assignment operation. The type of a string literal is an array of `char` (or an array of `wchar_t` for wide-string literals). Arrays in expressions are converted to pointers. See [String Literals](../c-language/c-string-literals.md) for more information about strings.
