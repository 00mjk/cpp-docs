# White-Space Characters
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [White-Space Characters](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/white-space-characters).  
  
Space, tab, linefeed, carriage-return, formfeed, vertical-tab, and newline characters are called "white-space characters" because they serve the same purpose as the spaces between words and lines on a printed page â€” they make reading easier. Tokens are delimited (bounded) by white-space characters and by other tokens, such as operators and punctuation. When parsing code, the C compiler ignores white-space characters unless you use them as separators or as components of character constants or string literals. Use white-space characters to make a program more readable. Note that the compiler also treats comments as white space.
