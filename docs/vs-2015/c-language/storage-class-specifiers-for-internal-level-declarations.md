# Storage-Class Specifiers for Internal-Level Declarations
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Storage-Class Specifiers for Internal-Level Declarations](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/storage-class-specifiers-for-internal-level-declarations).  
  
You can use any of four *storage-class-specifier* terminals for variable declarations at the internal level. When you omit the *storage-class-specifier* from such a declaration, the default storage class is **auto**. Therefore, the keyword **auto** is rarely seen in a C program.
