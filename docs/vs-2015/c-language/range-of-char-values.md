# Range of char Values
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Range of char Values](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/range-of-char-values).  
  
ANSI 3.2.1.1** Whether a "plain" **char** has the same range of values as a **signed char** or an `unsigned char`  
  
 All signed character values range from â€“128 to 127. All unsigned character values range from 0 to 255.  
  
 The /J compiler option changes the default from **signed** to `unsigned`.
