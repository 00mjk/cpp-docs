# ASCII Character Set
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [ASCII Character Set](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/ascii-character-set).  
  
ANSI 2.2.1** Members of source and execution character sets  
  
 The source character set is the set of legal characters that can appear in source files. For Microsoft C, the source character set is the standard ASCII character set.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  **Warning** Because keyboard and console drivers can remap the character set, programs intended for international distribution should check the Country/Region code.
