# Implementation-Defined Behavior
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Implementation-Defined Behavior](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/implementation-defined-behavior).  
  
ANSI X3.159-1989, *American National Standard for Information Systems* – *Programming Language* – *C*, contains a section called "Portability Issues." The ANSI section lists areas of the C language that ANSI leaves open to each particular implementation. This section describes how Microsoft C handles these implementation-defined areas of the C language.  
  
 This section follows the same order as the ANSI section. Each item covered includes references to the ANSI that explains the implementation-defined behavior.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  This section describes the U.S. English-language version of the C compiler only. Implementations of Microsoft C for other languages may differ slightly.
