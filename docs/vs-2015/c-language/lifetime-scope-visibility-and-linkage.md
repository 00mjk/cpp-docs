# Lifetime, Scope, Visibility, and Linkage
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Lifetime, Scope, Visibility, and Linkage](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/lifetime-scope-visibility-and-linkage).  
  
To understand how a C program works, you must understand the rules that determine how variables and functions can be used in the program. Several concepts are crucial to understanding these rules:  
  
-   [Lifetime](../c-language/lifetime.md)  
  
-   [Scope and visibility](../c-language/scope-and-visibility.md)  
  
-   [Linkage](../c-language/linkage.md)
