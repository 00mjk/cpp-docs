# Truncation of Floating-Point Values
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Truncation of Floating-Point Values](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/c-language/truncation-of-floating-point-values).  
  
ANSI 3.2.1.4** The direction of truncation or rounding when a floating-point number is converted to a narrower floating-point number  
  
 When an underflow occurs, the value of a floating-point variable is rounded down to zero. An overflow may cause a run-time error or it may produce an unpredictable value, depending on the optimizations specified.
