# User-Interface Updating for Record Views  (MFC Data Access)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [User-Interface Updating for Record Views  (MFC Data Access)](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/data/user-interface-updating-for-record-views-mfc-data-access).  
  
  
CRecordView` and `CDaoRecordView` also provide default user-interface update handlers for the navigation commands. These handlers automate enabling and disabling the user-interface objects â€” menu items and toolbar buttons. The application wizard supplies standard menus and, if you choose the **Dockable Toolbar** option, a set of toolbar buttons for the commands. If you create a record view class using `CRecordView`, you might want to add similar user-interface objects to your application.  
  
### To create menu resources with the menu editor  
  
1.  Referring to the information about using the [menu editor](../mfc/menu-editor.md), create your own menu with the same four commands.  
  
#### To create toolbar buttons with the graphics editor  
  
1.  Referring to the information about using the [toolbar editor](../mfc/toolbar-editor.md), edit the toolbar resource to add toolbar buttons for your record navigation commands.
