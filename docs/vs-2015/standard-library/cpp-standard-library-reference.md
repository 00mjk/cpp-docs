# C++ Standard Library Reference
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [C++ Standard Library Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/cpp-standard-library-reference).  
  
A C++ program can call on a large number of functions from this conforming implementation of the Standard C++ Library. These functions perform essential services such as input and output and provide efficient implementations of frequently used operations.  
  
 For more information about Visual C++ run-time libraries, see [CRT Library Features](../c-runtime-library/crt-library-features.md).
