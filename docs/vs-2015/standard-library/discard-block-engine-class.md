# discard_block_engine Class
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [discard_block_engine Class](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/standard-library/discard-block-engine-class).  
  
Generates a random sequence by discarding values returned by its base engine.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
template <class Engine, size_t P, size_t R>  
class discard_block_engine;  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `Engine`  
 The base engine type.  
  
 `P`  
 **Block size**. The number of values in each block.  
  
 `R`  
 **Used block**. The number of values in each block that are used. The rest are discarded ( `P` - `R`). **Precondition**: `0 < R â‰¤ P`
