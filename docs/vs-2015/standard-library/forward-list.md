```  
#include <forward_list>  
```  
  
### Operators  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[operator== (<forward_list>)](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#operator_eq_eq)|Tests if the forward list object on the left side of the operator is equal to the forward list object on the right side.|  
|[operator!= (<forward_list>)](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#operator_neq)|Tests if the forward list object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the forward list object on the right side.|  
|[operator< (<forward_list>)](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#operator_lt_)|Tests if the forward list object on the left side of the operator is less than the forward list object on the right side.|  
|[operator<= (<forward_list>)](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#operator_lt__eq)|Tests if the forward list object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the forward list object on the right side.|  
|[operator> (<forward_list>)](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#operator_gt_)|Tests if the forward list object on the left side of the operator is greater than the forward list object on the right side.|  
|[operator>= (<forward_list>)](../standard-library/forward-list-operators.md#operator_gt__eq)|Tests if the forward list object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the forward list object on the right side.|  
  
### Functions  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[swap (<forward_list>)](../standard-library/forward-list-functions.md#swap)|Exchanges the elements of two forward lists.|  
  
### Classes  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[forward_list](../standard-library/forward-list-class.md)|Describes an object that controls a varying-length sequence of elements. The sequence is stored as a singly-linked list of elements, each containing a member of type `Type`.|
