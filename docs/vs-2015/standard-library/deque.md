```cpp  
#include <deque>  
  
```  
  
### Operators  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[operator!=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#operator_neq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is not equal to the deque object on the right side.|  
|[operator<](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#operator_lt_)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than the deque object on the right side.|  
|[operator\<=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#operator_lt__eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is less than or equal to the deque object on the right side.|  
|[operator==](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#operator_eq_eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is equal to the deque object on the right side.|  
|[operator>](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#operator_gt_)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is greater than the deque object on the right side.|  
|[operator>=](../standard-library/deque-operators.md#operator_gt__eq)|Tests if the deque object on the left side of the operator is greater than or equal to the deque object on the right side.|  
  
### Functions  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[swap](../standard-library/deque-functions.md#swap)|Exchanges the elements of two deques.|  
  
### Classes  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|[deque Class](../standard-library/deque-class.md)|A template class of sequence containers that arrange elements of a given type in a linear arrangement and, like vectors, allow fast random access to any element and efficient insertion and deletion at the back of the container.|
