# C++ REST SDK (Codename &quot;Casablanca&quot;)
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

By using the C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca"), you can more easily write modern, asynchronous C++ code that connects with cloud-based services.  
  
 The Casablanca project no longer ships with Visual Studio. The documentation and sources are hosted and occasionally updated on CodePlex. For more detailed information about this project, see [C++ REST SDK (codename "Casablanca")](http://casablanca.codeplex.com/).
