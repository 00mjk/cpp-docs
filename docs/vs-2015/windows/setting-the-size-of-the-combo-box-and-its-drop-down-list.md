# Setting the Size of the Combo Box and Its Drop-Down List
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Setting the Size of the Combo Box and Its Drop-Down List](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/setting-the-size-of-the-combo-box-and-its-drop-down-list).  
  
  
You can size a combo box when you add it to the dialog box. You can also specify the size of the drop-down list box.  
  
### To size a combo box  
  
1.  Select the combo-box control in your dialog box.  
  
     Initially, only the right and left sizing handles are active.  
  
2.  Use the sizing handles to set the width of the combo box.  
  
 You can also set the vertical size of the drop-down portion of the combo box.  
  
#### To set the size of the combo box drop-down list  
  
1.  Click the drop-down arrow button at the right of the combo box.  
  
     ![Arrow on a combo box in an MFC project](../mfc/media/vccomboboxarrow.gif "vcComboBoxArrow")  
  
     The outline of the control changes to show the size of the combo box with the drop-down list area extended.  
  
2.  Use the lower sizing handle to change the initial size of the drop-down list area.
