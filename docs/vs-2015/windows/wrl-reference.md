# WRL Reference
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [WRL Reference](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/wrl-reference).  
  
  
This section contains reference information for the [!INCLUDE[cppwrl](../includes/cppwrl-md.md)] ([!INCLUDE[cppwrl_short](../includes/cppwrl-short-md.md)]).  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  The [!INCLUDE[cppwrl_short](../includes/cppwrl-short-md.md)] defines functionality that supports the [!INCLUDE[cppwrl_short](../includes/cppwrl-short-md.md)] infrastructure and is not intended to be used directly from your code. Such functionality is noted in this documentation.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Microsoft::WRL Namespace](../windows/microsoft-wrl-namespace.md)  
 Defines the fundamental types that make up the [!INCLUDE[cppwrl_short](../includes/cppwrl-short-md.md)].  
  
 [Microsoft::WRL::Wrappers Namespace](../windows/microsoft-wrl-wrappers-namespace.md)  
 Defines Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII) wrapper types that simplify the lifetime management of objects, strings, and handles.  
  
 [Microsoft::WRL::Wrappers::HandleTraits Namespace](../windows/microsoft-wrl-wrappers-handletraits-namespace.md)  
 Describes characteristics of common handle-based resource types.  
  
 [Windows::Foundation Namespace](../windows/windows-foundation-namespace.md)  
 Enables fundamental [!INCLUDE[wrt](../includes/wrt-md.md)] functionality, such as object and factory creation.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [Windows Runtime C++ Template Library (WRL)](../windows/windows-runtime-cpp-template-library-wrl.md)  
 Introduces [!INCLUDE[cppwrl_short](../includes/cppwrl-short-md.md)], a COM-based template library that provides a low-level way to author and use [!INCLUDE[wrt](../includes/wrt-md.md)] components.
