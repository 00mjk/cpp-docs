# Viewing a Menu as a Pop-up Menu
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [Viewing a Menu as a Pop-up Menu](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/viewing-a-menu-as-a-pop-up-menu).  
  
  
Normally, when you are working in the Menu editor, a menu resource is displayed as a menu bar. However, you might have menu resources that are added to the application's menu bar while the program is running.  
  
### To view a menu resource as a pop-up menu  
  
1.  Right-click the menu and choose **View as Popup** from the shortcut menu.  
  
     This is only a viewing preference and will not modify your menu.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  To change back to the menu-bar view, click **View as Popup** again (which removes the check mark and returns your menu-bar view).  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).  
  
 **Requirements**
