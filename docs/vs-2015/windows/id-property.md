# ID Property
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [ID Property](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/id-property).  
  
  
The ID property references each accelerator table entry in program code. This is the command value that the program will receive when a user presses the accelerator key or a key combination. To make an accelerator the same as a menu item, make their IDs the same (so long as the ID of the accelerator table is the same as the ID for the menu resource).
