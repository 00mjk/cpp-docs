# ATL Predefined Symbols
[!INCLUDE[blank_token](../includes/blank-token.md)]

The latest version of this topic can be found at [ATL Predefined Symbols](https://docs.microsoft.com/cpp/windows/atl-predefined-symbols).  
  
  
These symbols are defined in the ATL header files, but they support standard Windows application functions and actions. These symbols are mainly used with dialog boxes. When you are working with dialogs and controls in the [Dialog editor](../mfc/dialog-editor.md), these symbols will appear in the Properties window associated with common controls. For instance, if your dialog box has a Cancel button, that command will be associated with the symbol IDCANCEL in the [Properties Window](../Topic/Properties%20Window.md).  
  
|||  
|-|-|  
|IDABORT|Control: Dialog box Abort button|  
|IDC_STATIC|Control: Static control|  
|IDCANCEL|Control: Dialog box Cancel button|  
|IDIGNORE|Control: Dialog box Ignore button|  
|IDNO|Control: Dialog box No button|  
|IDOK|Control: Dialog box OK button|  
|IDR_ACCELERATOR1|Resource: Accelerator table|  
|IDRETRY|Control: Dialog box Retry button|  
|IDS_PROJNAME|String: Current application name|
