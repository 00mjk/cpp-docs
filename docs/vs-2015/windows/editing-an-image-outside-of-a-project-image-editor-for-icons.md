You can open and edit images in the development environment just as you would in any graphics application. The images you work with need not be part of a Visual Studio project for stand-alone editing.  
  
### To open a bitmap for stand-alone editing  
  
1.  From the **File** menu, click **Open**.  
  
2.  In the **Files of Type** box, click **All Files**.  
  
3.  Locate and open the image you want to edit.
