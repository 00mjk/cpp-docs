# Internationalization

The Microsoft runtime library provides many routines that you can use to customize your app for international markets. This includes [locale-related routines](../c-runtime-library/locale.md), wide-character routines, multibyte-character routines, and generic-text routines.

For convenience, most locale-related routines are also categorized by what they do. 

In this section, and in the alphabetic reference, multibyte and wide-character routines are described along with their single-byte-character counterparts, when they exist.

ISO646 operator alternatives are also included.
