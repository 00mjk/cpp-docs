# C Run-Time Library Reference

The Microsoft run-time library provides routines for programming for the Microsoft Windows operating system. These routines automate many common programming tasks that are not provided by the C and C++ languages.

Sample programs are included in the individual reference topics for most routines in the library.

## In This Section

[C Run-Time Libraries](crt-library-features.md)\
Discusses the .lib files that comprise the C run-time libraries.

[Universal C runtime routines by category](run-time-routines-by-category.md)\
Provides links to the run-time library by category.

[Global Variables and Standard Types](global-variables-and-standard-types.md)\
Provides links to the global variables and standard types provided by the run-time library.

[Global Constants](global-constants.md)\
Provides links to the global constants defined by the run-time library.

[Global State](global-state.md)\
Describes the scope of global state in the C run-time library.

[Alphabetical Function Reference](reference/crt-alphabetical-function-reference.md)\
Provides a table of contents entry point into an alphabetical listing of all C run-time library functions.

[Generic-Text Mappings](generic-text-mappings.md)\
Provides links to the generic-text mappings defined in Tchar.h.

[Language and Country/Region Strings](locale-names-languages-and-country-region-strings.md)\
Describes how to use the `setlocale` function to set the language and Country/Region strings.

## Related Sections

[Debug Routines](debug-routines.md)\
Provides links to the debug versions of the run-time library routines.

[Run-Time Error Checking](run-time-error-checking.md)\
Provides links to functions that support run-time error checks.

[DLLs and Visual C++ run-time library behavior](../build/run-time-library-behavior.md)\
Discusses the entry point and startup code used for a DLL.

[Debugging](/visualstudio/debugger/debugging-in-visual-studio)\
Provides links to using the Visual Studio debugger to correct logic errors in your application or stored procedures.
