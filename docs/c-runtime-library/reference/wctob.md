# wctob
Determines if a wide character corresponds to a multibyte character and returns its multibyte character representation.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
int wctob(  
   wint_t wchar  
);  
```  
  
#### Parameters  
 `wchar`  
 Value to translate.  
  
## Return Value  
 If `wctob` successfully converts a wide character, it returns its multibyte character representation, only if the multibyte character is exactly one byte long. If `wctob` encounters a wide character it cannot convert to a multibyte character or the multibyte character is not exactly one byte long, it returns a -1.  
  
## Remarks  
 The `wctob` function converts a wide character contained in `wchar` to the corresponding multibyte character passed by the return `int` value, if the multibyte character is exactly one byte long.  
  
 If `wctob` was unsuccessful and no corresponding multibyte character was found, the function sets `errno` to `EILSEQ` and returns -1.  
  
## Requirements  
  
|Routine|Required header|  
|-------------|---------------------|  
|`wctob`|\<wchar.h>|  
  
 For additional compatibility information, see [Compatibility](../../c-runtime-library/compatibility.md) in the Introduction.  
  
## Example  
 This program illustrates the behavior of the `wcstombs` function.  
  
```  
// crt_wctob.c  
#include <stdio.h>  
#include <wchar.h>  
  
int main( void )  
{  
    int     bChar = 0;  
    wint_t  wChar = 0;  
  
    // Set the corresponding wide character to exactly one byte.  
    wChar = (wint_t)'A';  
  
    bChar = wctob( wChar );  
    if (bChar == WEOF)  
    {  
        printf( "No corresponding multibyte character was found.\n");  
    }  
    else  
    {  
        printf( "Determined the corresponding multibyte character to"  
                " be \"%c\".\n", bChar);  
    }  
}  
  
```  
  
```Output  
Determined the corresponding multibyte character to be "A".  
```
