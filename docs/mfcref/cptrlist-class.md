# CPtrList Class
Supports lists of void pointers.  
  
## Syntax  
  
```  
class CPtrList : public CObject  
```  
  
## Members  
 The member functions of `CPtrList` are similar to the member functions of class [CObList](../mfcref/coblist-class.md). Because of this similarity, you can use the `CObList` reference documentation for member function specifics. Wherever you see a `CObject` pointer as a function parameter or return value, substitute a pointer to `void`.  
  
 `CObject*& CObList::GetHead() const;`  
  
 for example, translates to  
  
 `void*& CPtrList::GetHead() const;`  
  
## Remarks  
 `CPtrList` incorporates the `IMPLEMENT_DYNAMIC` macro to support run-time type access and dumping to a `CDumpContext` object. If you need a dump of individual pointer list elements, you must set the depth of the dump context to 1 or greater.  
  
 Pointer lists cannot be serialized.  
  
 When a `CPtrList` object is deleted, or when its elements are removed, only the pointers are removed, not the entities they reference.  
  
 For more information on using `CPtrList`, see the article [Collections](../mfc/collections.md).
