# Navigate the class structure (Visual C++)

You can navigate a project class structure by using either **Class View** or the **Object Browser**. The project class structure may include functions, inheritance, and interfaces. For more information, see [View the structure of code](/visualstudio/ide/viewing-the-structure-of-code).

To go to a function declaration, double-click the function name in Class View. To go to a class definition, double-click a class name in Class View.
