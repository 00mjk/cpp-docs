# Adding a Method  (Visual C++)

You can use the [Add Method Wizard](../ide/add-method-wizard.md) to add a method to an interface in your project. If the project contains a class associated with the interface, the wizard modifies the class, too.

### To add a method to your object

1. In Class View, expand the project node to display the interface to which you want to add the method.

   > [!NOTE]
   > You can also add methods to dispinterfaces, which, unless the project is attributed, are located under the library node.

1. Right-click the name of the interface.

1. On the shortcut menu, click **Add**, and then click **Add Method**.

1. In the Add Method Wizard, provide the information to create the method.

1. Specify any interface definition language settings for this method in the [IDL attributes](../ide/idl-attributes-add-method-wizard.md) page of the wizard.

1. Click **Finish** to add the method.
