# Adding a Member Function (Visual C++)

In **Class View**, you can add a member function to any class. When you do this, a declaration is added to the header file, and a stub member-function body is added to the class's implementation file, which you can then modify.

### To add a member function to a class

1. In **Class View**, expand the project node to display the classes in the project. (To open **Class View**, on the menu bar, choose **View**, **Class View**.)

1. Open the shortcut menu for the class you want to add a member function to, and then choose **Add**, **Add Function**.

1. Provide the appropriate details about the member function. For more information, see [Add Member Function Wizard](../ide/add-member-function-wizard.md).

1. Choose the **Finish** button to generate the member function code.
