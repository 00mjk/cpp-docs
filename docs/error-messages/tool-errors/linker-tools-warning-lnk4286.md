# Linker Tools Warning LNK4286

> symbol '*symbol*' defined in '*filename_1.obj*' is imported by '*filename_2.obj*'

The symbol was both exported from and imported to the program.

## Remarks

This warning is generated by the linker when you declare a symbol by using the `__declspec(dllexport)` storage-class attribute in one object file, and reference it by using the `__declspec(dllimport)` attribute in another, in the same module.

Warning LNK4286 is a more general version of [Linker Tools Warning LNK4217](linker-tools-warning-lnk4217.md). The linker generates Warning LNK4286 when it can tell which object file referenced the symbol, but not which function.

To resolve LNK4286, remove the `__declspec(dllimport)` name declaration from the forward declaration of the symbol which triggered LNK4286.

Although the final generated code behaves correctly, the code generated to call an imported function is less efficient than calling the function directly. This warning doesn't appear when you compile by using the option [/clr](../../build/reference/clr-common-language-runtime-compilation.md).

For more information on import and export data declarations, see [dllexport, dllimport](../../cpp/dllexport-dllimport.md).
