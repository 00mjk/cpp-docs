cannot position in file 'filename' [: reason]  
  
 BSCMAKE could not move to a location in the file.  
  
### To fix by checking the following possible causes  
  
1.  A full disk.  
  
2.  A hardware error.  
  
3.  File truncation due to insufficient disk space or interruption of the compiler while creating the .sbr file.
