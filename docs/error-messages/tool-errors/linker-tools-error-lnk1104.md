# Linker Tools Error LNK1104
cannot open file '*filename*'  
  
The linker could not open the specified file.  
  
To fix this error, check for the following possible causes:  
  
-   The file *filename* does not exist. If your project depends on another project to produce this file, make sure your project dependencies are set correctly.  
  
-   When specifying libraries in a project's Property Pages dialog box, library names must be separated by spaces, not commas.  
  
-   The filename or path specified on the command line is incorrect, or the path has an invalid drive specification. Check your spelling and verify the file name and location. If you are building a project that was copied from another computer, check the paths on the [VC++ Directories Property Page](../../ide/vcpp-directories-property-page.md) and update them if necessary.  
  
-   The libraries for the project configuration or platform toolset are not installed. Verify that the platform toolset and Windows SDK specified in the Property Pages for your project is installed, and includes the toolset and libraries needed by your configuration settings. There are separate settings for Debug and Retail configurations, so if one build works but the other causes an error, make sure the settings are correct and the required tools are installed for both configurations.  
  
-   You don't have enough disk space. It's not unusual for the linker to consume a lot of temporary disk space during a link.  
  
-   You have insufficient file permissions to access *filename*.  
  
-   The path for *filename* expands to more than 260 characters. Change the names or rearrange your directory structure if needed to shorten the paths to the required files.  
  
-   If the *filename* is named LNK*n*, which is a filename generated by the linker for a temporary file, the directory specified in the TMP environment variable may not exist, or more than one directory may be specified for the TMP environment variable. Only one directory path should be specified for the TMP environment variable.  
  
-   If the error message occurs for a library name, and you recently ported the .mak file from a previous Microsoft Visual C++ development system, the library may no longer be valid. Ensure that the library name is correct and still exists in the specified location, or update the LIB path to point to the new location.  
  
-   Another program may have the file open and the linker cannot write to it. Antivirus programs often temporarily block access to newly created files. Try excluding your project build directories from the antivirus scanner.  
  
-   You have an incorrect LIB environment variable. For information on how to update the LIB environment variable, see [VC++ Directories Property Page](../../ide/vcpp-directories-property-page.md). Make sure any directories with libraries you need are listed here.  
  
-   The linker uses temporary files in several cases. Even if you have sufficient disk space, a very large link can deplete or fragment the available disk space. Consider using the [/OPT (Optimizations)](../../build/reference/opt-optimizations.md) option; doing transitive comdat elimination reads all the object files multiple times.
