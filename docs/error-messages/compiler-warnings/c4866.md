# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4866

> '_file_(*line_number*)' compiler may not enforce left-to-right evaluation order for call to _operator_name_

The operands of the operators `->*`, `[]`, `>>`, `<<` are to be evaluated in left-to-right order under C++17. There are two cases in which the compiler is unable to guarantee this order: the first is when one of the operand expressions is or contains an object passed by value; the second is  when compiling with `/clr` and one of the operands are fields of objects or are array elements. When the compiler can't guarantee left-to-right evaluation it emits warning C4866. This warning can only be generated if `/std:c++17` or `/std:c++latest` are used, as the left-to-right order requirement of these operators was introduced in C++17. 

This warning was introduced in Visual Studio 2017 version 15.9. This warning can be generated as a result of compiler conformance work that was done for Visual C++ 2017 version 15.9. Code that compiled prior to Visual C++ 2017 version 15.9 can now generate C4866.

This warning is off by default; you can use `/Wall` or `/wN4866` to enable it on the command line, or use #pragma [warning](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/preprocessor/warning?view=vs-2017) in your source file.

To resolve this warning, first consider whether left-to-right evaluation of the operator elements is necessary, such as when evaluation of the elements might produce order-dependent side-effects. In many cases, the order in which elements are evaluated does not have an observable effect.

If the order of evaluation must be left-to-right, consider if it's possible to pass the elements by `const` reference instead. A change such as this eliminates the warning in the following code sample.

## Example

This sample generates C4866, and shows a way to fix it:

```cpp
// C4866.cpp
// compile with: /w14866 /std:c++17

class HasCopyConstructor
{
public:
	int x;

	HasCopyConstructor(int x) : x(x) {}
	HasCopyConstructor(const HasCopyConstructor& h) : x(h.x) { }
};

int operator->*(HasCopyConstructor a, HasCopyConstructor b) { return a.x + b.x; }

// This variation will not trigger the warning:  
// int operator->*(const HasCopyConstructor& a, const HasCopyConstructor& b) { return a.x + b.x; }

int main()
{
	HasCopyConstructor a{ 1 };
	HasCopyConstructor b{ 2 };

	// the warning will indicate the below line, the usage of the operator->*.
	a->*b;
};
```
