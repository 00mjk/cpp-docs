# Fatal Error C1033

cannot open program database pdb

This error can be caused by a disk error, a temporary lock created by an anti-virus program, a previous debugger instance that has not fully shut down, or parallel build mspdbsrv.exe processes that attempt to access the same file, among other possible causes.
