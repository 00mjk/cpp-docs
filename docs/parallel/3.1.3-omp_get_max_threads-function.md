# 3.1.3 omp_get_max_threads Function
The **omp_get_max_threads** function returns an integer that is guaranteed to be at least as large as the number of threads that would be used to form a team if a parallel region without a **num_threads** clause were to be encountered at that point in the code. The format is as follows:  
  
```  
#include <omp.h>  
int omp_get_max_threads(void);  
```  
  
 The following expresses a lower bound on the value of **omp_get_max_threads**:  
  
```  
  
threads-used-for-next-team  
 <= omp_get_max_threads  
  
```  
  
 Note that if a subsequent parallel region uses the **num_threads** clause to request a specific number of threads, the guarantee on the lower bound of the result of **omp_get_max_threads** no long holds.  
  
 The **omp_get_max_threads** function's return value can be used to dynamically allocate sufficient storage for all threads in the team formed at the subsequent parallel region.
