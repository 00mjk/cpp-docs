Provides links to data types used in the OpenMP API.  
  
 The Visual C++ implementation of the OpenMP standard includes the following data types.  
  
|Data type|Description|  
|---------------|-----------------|  
|[omp_lock_t](../parallel/omp_lock_t.md)|A type that holds the status of a lock, whether the lock is available or if a thread owns a lock.|  
|[omp_nest_lock_t](../parallel/omp_nest_lock_t.md)|A type that holds one of the following pieces of information about a lock: whether the lock is available, and the identity of the thread that owns the lock and a nesting count.|
