# Attribute Requirements
The requirements listed for C++ attributes describe the project types, compiler settings, and other information necessary for an attribute to work. The categories of information are described below.  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  Using attributes on a class that derives from a class that also uses attributes is not supported.
