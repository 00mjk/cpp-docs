# LIB Input Files
The input files expected by LIB depend on the mode in which it is being used, as shown in the following table.  
  
|Mode|Input|  
|----------|-----------|  
|Default (building or modifying a library)|COFF object (.obj) files, COFF libraries (.lib), 32-bit Object Model Format (OMF) object (.obj) files|  
|Extracting a member with /EXTRACT|COFF library (.lib)|  
|Building an export file and import library with /DEF|Module-definition (.def) file, COFF object (.obj) files, COFF libraries (.lib), 32-bit OMF object (.obj) files|  
  
> [!NOTE]
>  OMF libraries created by the 16-bit version of LIB cannot be used as input to the 32-bit version of LIB.
