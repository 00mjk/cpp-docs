# Compiler Error C2827
'operator operator' cannot be globally overridden with unary form  
  
 The operator cannot have a unary form outside of an object.  
  
### To fix by using the following possible solutions  
  
1.  Make the overloaded operator local to an object.  
  
2.  Choose an appropriate unary operator to overload.
