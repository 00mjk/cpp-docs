# Drawing Tool Classes
These classes encapsulate drawing tools that are used to draw on a device context.  
  
 [CGdiObject](../VS_visualcpp/CGdiObject-Class.md)  
 The base class for GDI drawing tools.  
  
 [CBrush](../VS_visualcpp/CBrush-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI brush that can be selected as the current brush in a device context. Brushes are used for filling interiors of objects being drawn.  
  
 [CPen](../VS_visualcpp/CPen-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI pen that can be selected as the current pen in a device context. Pens are used for drawing the border lines of objects.  
  
 [CFont](../VS_visualcpp/CFont-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI font that can be selected as the current font in a device context.  
  
 [CBitmap](../VS_visualcpp/CBitmap-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI bitmap, providing an interface for manipulating bitmaps.  
  
 [CPalette](../VS_visualcpp/CPalette-Class.md)  
 Encapsulates a GDI color palette for use as an interface between the application and a color output device such as a display.  
  
 [CRectTracker](../VS_visualcpp/CRectTracker-Class.md)  
 Displays and handles the user interface for resizing and moving rectangular objects.
