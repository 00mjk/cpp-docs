# Types of Expressions
C++ expressions are divided into several categories:  
  
-   [Primary expressions](../VS_visualcpp/Primary-Expressions.md). These are the building blocks from which all other expressions are formed.  
  
-   [Postfix expressions](../VS_visualcpp/Postfix-Expressions.md). These are primary expressions followed by an operator — for example, the array subscript or postfix increment operator.  
  
-   [Expressions formed with unary operators](../VS_visualcpp/Expressions-with-Unary-Operators.md). Unary operators act on only one operand in an expression.  
  
-   [Expressions formed with binary operators](../VS_visualcpp/Expressions-with-Binary-Operators.md). Binary operators act on two operands in an expression.  
  
-   [Expressions with the conditional operator](../VS_visualcpp/Conditional-Operator-----.md). The conditional operator is a ternary operator — the only such operator in the C++ language — and takes three operands.  
  
-   [Constant expressions](../VS_visualcpp/C---Constant-Expressions.md). Constant expressions are formed entirely of constant data.  
  
-   [Expressions with explicit type conversions](assetId:///060ad6b4-9592-4f3e-8509-a20ac84a85ae). Explicit type conversions, or "casts," can be used in expressions.  
  
-   [Expressions with pointer-to-member operators](../VS_visualcpp/Pointer-to-Member-Operators--.--and----.md).  
  
-   [Casting](../VS_visualcpp/Casting.md). Type-safe "casts" can be used in expressions.  
  
-   [Run-Time Type Information](../VS_visualcpp/Run-Time-Type-Information.md). Determine the type of an object during program execution.
