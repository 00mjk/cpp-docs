# Application Settings, Custom Wizard
Use this page of the Custom Wizard to design a wizard.  
  
 **Wizard friendly name**  
 Sets the name of the wizard that you are designing. This name is displayed in the ReadMe.txt file and as the title in the HTML file.  
  
 **User interface**  
 The default. Specifies that the custom wizard displays a user interface. If you want the user to select options specifying what code that your wizard generates, the wizard must have a user interface. The wizard does not need a user interface if its purpose is to generate template code with no user options.  
  
 **Number of pages**  
 Sets the number of pages your custom wizard requires. This option applies only to a wizard that has a user interface.
