# ATL COM Desktop Components
The ATL Reference documents the Active Template Library (ATL), a set of template-based C++ classes that simplify the programming of Component Object Model (COM) objects. To fully take advantage of ATL, a working familiarity with COM is highly recommended.  
  
## In This Section  
 [ATL Class Overview](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Class-Overview.md)  
 Provides links to and brief descriptions of the ATL classes organized by category.  
  
 [ATL Classes](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Classes.md)  
 Provides reference material on the classes organized alphabetically.  
  
 [ATL Functions](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Functions.md)  
 Provides reference material on the global functions organized alphabetically. Includes topics organizing the functions into categories.  
  
 [ATL Global Variables](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Global-Variables.md)  
 Provides reference material on the global variables organized alphabetically.  
  
 [ATL Macros](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Macros.md)  
 Provides reference material on the macros organized alphabetically. Includes topics organizing the macros into categories.  
  
 [ATL Structures](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Structures.md)  
 Provides reference material on the structures organized alphabetically.  
  
 [ATL Typedefs](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Typedefs.md)  
 Provides reference material on the typedefs organized alphabetically  
  
 [Archetypes](../VS_visualcpp/ATL-Archetypes.md)  
 Provides links to the ATL archetypes, which are theoretical classes that supply a collection of methods, data members, static functions, typedefs, or other features, listed alphabetically.  
  
 [Obsolete ATL Topics](assetId:///7af0223d-148e-4a4c-bf9c-3e916a3b67ec)  
 Provides reference material on the classes, macros, and functions that are obsolete or deprecated.
