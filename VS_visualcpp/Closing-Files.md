# Closing Files
As usual in I/O operations, once you finish with a file, you must close it.  
  
#### To close a file  
  
1.  Use the **Close** member function. This function closes the file-system file and flushes buffers if necessary.  
  
 If you allocated the [CFile](../VS_visualcpp/CFile-Class.md) object on the frame (as in the example shown in [Opening Files](../VS_visualcpp/Opening-Files.md)), the object will automatically be closed and then destroyed when it goes out of scope. Note that deleting the `CFile` object does not delete the physical file in the file system.
