# Changing the Caption Property of Multiple Strings
The following procedure shows you how to change the caption property of multiple strings.  
  
### To change the caption property of multiple strings  
  
1.  Open the string table by double-clicking its icon in [Resource View](../VS_visualcpp/Resource-View-Window.md).  
  
     **Note** If your project doesn't already contain an .rc file, please see [Creating a New Resource Script File](../VS_visualcpp/How-to--Create-a-Resource-Script-File.md).  
  
2.  Select the strings you want to change by holding down the **CTRL** key as you click each one.  
  
3.  In the [Properties Window](../Topic/Properties%20Window.md), type a new value for the property you want to change.  
  
4.  Press **ENTER**.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects (those that target the common language runtime), please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](assetId:///9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).
