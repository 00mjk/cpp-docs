# Using the Visual Studio IDE for C++ Desktop Development
The Visual Studio Integrated Development Environment (IDE) offers a set of tools that help you write and modify code, and also detect and correct errors.  
  
 In the articles in this section of the documentation, you create a standard C++ program and test its functionality by using features in Visual Studio. The basic program that you create tracks how many players are playing different card games.  
  
 Here are the articles:
