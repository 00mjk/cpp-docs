# Multithreading Support for Older Code (Visual C++)
Visual C++ allows you to have multiple concurrent threads of execution running simultaneously. With multithreading, you can spin off background tasks, manage simultaneous streams of input, manage a user interface, and much more.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Multithreading with C and Win32](../VS_visualcpp/Multithreading-with-C-and-Win32.md)  
 Provides support for creating multithread applications with Microsoft Windows  
  
 [Multithreading with C++ and MFC](../VS_visualcpp/Multithreading-with-C---and-MFC.md)  
 Describes what processes and threads are and what the MFC approach to multithreading is.  
  
 [Multithreading and Locales](../VS_visualcpp/Multithreading-and-Locales.md)  
 Discusses issues that arise when using the locale functionality of both the C Runtime Library and the Standard C++ Library in a multithreaded application.  
  
## Related Sections  
 [CWinThread](../VS_visualcpp/CWinThread-Class.md)  
 Represents a thread of execution within an application.  
  
 [CSyncObject](../VS_visualcpp/CSyncObject-Class.md)  
 Describes a pure virtual class that provides functionality common to the synchronization objects in Win32.  
  
 [CSemaphore](../VS_visualcpp/CSemaphore-Class.md)  
 Represents a semaphore, which is a synchronization object that allows a limited number of threads in one or more processes to access a resource.  
  
 [CMutex](../VS_visualcpp/CMutex-Class.md)  
 Represents a mutex, which is a synchronization object that allows one thread mutually exclusive access to a resource.  
  
 [CCriticalSection](../VS_visualcpp/CCriticalSection-Class.md)  
 Represents a critical section, which is a synchronization object that allows one thread at a time to access a resource or section of code.  
  
 [CEvent](../VS_visualcpp/CEvent-Class.md)  
 Represents an event, which is a synchronization object that allows one thread to notify another that an event has occurred.  
  
 [CMultiLock](../VS_visualcpp/CMultiLock-Class.md)  
 Represents the access-control mechanism used in controlling access to resources in a multithreaded program.  
  
 [CSingleLock](../VS_visualcpp/CSingleLock-Class.md)  
 Represents the access-control mechanism used in controlling access to a resource in a multithreaded program.  
  
 [(NOTINBUILD)Visual C++ Programming Methodologies](assetId:///0822f806-fa81-4b65-bf0f-1e2921f30c95)  
 Provides links to topics describing conceptual information about the Visual C++ libraries and topics discussing various coding technologies and techniques.
