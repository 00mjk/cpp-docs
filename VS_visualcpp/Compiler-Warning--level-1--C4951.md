# Compiler Warning (level 1) C4951
'function' has been edited since profile data was collected, function profile data not used  
  
 A function has been edited in an input module to [/LTCG:PGUPDATE](../VS_visualcpp/-LTCG--Link-time-Code-Generation-.md), so that the profile data is now not valid. The input module was recompiled after **/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT** and has a function (***function***) with a different flow of control than was in the module at the time of the **/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT** operation.  
  
 This warning is informational. To resolve this warning, run **/LTCG:PGINSTRUMENT**, redo all test runs, and run **/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE**.  
  
 This warning would be replaced with an error if **/LTCG:PGOPTIMIZE** had been used.
