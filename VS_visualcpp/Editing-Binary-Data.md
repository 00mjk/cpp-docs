# Editing Binary Data
### To edit a resource in the Binary editor  
  
1.  Select the byte you want to edit.  
  
     The TAB key moves the focus between the hexadecimal and ASCII sections of the Binary editor. You can use the PAGE UP and PAGE DOWN keys to move through the resource one screen at a time.  
  
2.  Type the new value.  
  
     The value changes immediately in both the hexadecimal and ASCII sections and focus shifts to the next value in line.  
  
    > [!NOTE]
    >  The Binary editor accepts changes automatically when you close the editor.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.* For information on manually adding resource files to managed projects, accessing resources, displaying static resources, and assigning resources strings to properties, see [Walkthrough: Localizing Windows Forms](assetId:///9a96220d-a19b-4de0-9f48-01e5d82679e5) and [Walkthrough: Using Resources for Localization with ASP.NET](../Topic/Walkthrough:%20Using%20Resources%20for%20Localization%20with%20ASP.NET.md).
