# Iteration Statements (C++)
Iteration statements cause statements (or compound statements) to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria. When these statements are compound statements, they are executed in order, except when either the [break](../VS_visualcpp/break-Statement--C---.md) statement or the [continue](../VS_visualcpp/continue-Statement--C---.md) statement is encountered.  
  
 C++ provides four iteration statements â€” [while](../VS_visualcpp/while-Statement--C---.md), [do](../VS_visualcpp/do-while-Statement--C---.md), [for](../VS_visualcpp/for-Statement--C---.md), and [range-based for](../VS_visualcpp/Range-based-for-Statement--C---.md). Each of these iterates until its termination expression evaluates to zero (false), or until loop termination is forced with a **break** statement. The following table summarizes these statements and their actions; each is discussed in detail in the sections that follow.  
  
### Iteration Statements  
  
|Statement|Evaluated At|Initialization|Increment|  
|---------------|------------------|--------------------|---------------|  
|`while`|Top of loop|No|No|  
|**do**|Bottom of loop|No|No|  
|**for**|Top of loop|Yes|Yes|  
|**range-based for**|Top of loop|Yes|Yes|  
  
 The statement part of an iteration statement cannot be a declaration. However, it can be a compound statement containing a declaration.
