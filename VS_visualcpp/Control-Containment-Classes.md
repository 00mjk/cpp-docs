-   [CAxWindow](../VS_visualcpp/CAxWindow-Class.md) Provides methods for manipulating a window that hosts an ActiveX control.  
  
-   [CAxWindow2T](../VS_visualcpp/CAxWindow2T-Class.md) Provides methods for manipulating a window that hosts an ActiveX control and also has support for hosting licensed ActiveX controls.  
  
-   [IAxWinAmbientDispatch](../VS_visualcpp/IAxWinAmbientDispatch-Interface.md) Call the methods on this interface to set the ambient properties available to a hosted control.  
  
-   [IAxWinHostWindow](../VS_visualcpp/IAxWinHostWindow-Interface.md) Call the methods on this interface to create and/or attach a control to a host object, or to get an interface from a hosted control.
