# Modifying the Layout Grid
When you are placing or arranging controls in a dialog box, you can use the layout grid for more precise positioning. When the grid is turned on, controls appear to "snap to" the dotted lines of the grid as if magnetized. You can turn this "snap to grid" feature on and off and change the size of the layout grid cells.  
  
### To turn the layout grid on or off  
  
1.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Guide Settings**.  
  
2.  In the [Guide Settings Dialog Box](../VS_visualcpp/Guide-Settings-Dialog-Box.md), select or clear the **Grid** button.  
  
     You can still control the grid in individual Dialog editor windows using the **Toggle Grid** button on the [Dialog Editor Toolbar](../VS_visualcpp/Showing-or-Hiding-the-Dialog-Editor-Toolbar.md).  
  
### To change the size of the layout grid  
  
1.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Guide Settings**.  
  
2.  In the [Guide Settings Dialog Box](../VS_visualcpp/Guide-Settings-Dialog-Box.md), type the height and width in DLUs for the cells in the grid. The minimum height or width is 4 DLUs. For more information on DLUs, see [The Arrangement of Controls on Dialog Boxes](../VS_visualcpp/Arrangement-of-Controls-on-Dialog-Boxes.md).
