# Native and .NET Interoperability
Visual C++ supports interoperability features that allow managed and unmanaged constructs to co-exist and interoperate within the same assembly, and even in the same file. A small subset of this functionality, such as P/Invoke, is supported by other .NET languages as well, but most of the interoperability support provided by Visual C++ is not available in other languages.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Mixed (Native and Managed) Assemblies](../VS_visualcpp/Mixed--Native-and-Managed--Assemblies.md)  
 Describes assemblies generated with the [/clr (Common Language Runtime Compilation)](../VS_visualcpp/-clr--Common-Language-Runtime-Compilation-.md) compiler option that contain both managed and unmanaged functionality.  
  
 [Using a Windows Form User Control in MFC](../VS_visualcpp/Using-a-Windows-Form-User-Control-in-MFC.md)  
 Discusses how to use the MFC Windows Forms support classes to host Windows Forms controls within your MFC applications.  
  
 [Calling Native Functions from Managed Code](../VS_visualcpp/Calling-Native-Functions-from-Managed-Code.md)  
 Describes how non-CLR DLLs can be used from .NET applications.
