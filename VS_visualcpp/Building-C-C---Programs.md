# Building C-C++ Programs
You can build Visual C++ projects either in Visual Studio or on the command line. The Visual Studio IDE uses [MSBuild](../VS_visualcpp/MSBuild--Visual-C---.md) to build projects and solutions. On the command line, you can use the C/C++ compiler (cl.exe) and linker (link.exe) to build simple projects. To build more complex projects on the command line, you can use MSBuild or [NMAKE](../VS_visualcpp/NMAKE-Reference.md). For an overview about how to use Visual Studio to build projects and solutions, see [Compiling and Building](../Topic/Compiling%20and%20Building%20in%20Visual%20Studio.md).  
  
## In This Section  
 [Building C++ Projects in Visual Studio](../VS_visualcpp/Building-C---Projects-in-Visual-Studio.md)  
 Discusses how to use the Visual Studio IDE to build your C/C++ project.  
  
 [Building on the Command Line](../VS_visualcpp/Building-on-the-Command-Line.md)  
 Discusses how to use the C/C++ command-line compiler and build tools that are included in Visual Studio.  
  
 [Building C/C++ Isolated Applications and Side-by-side Assemblies](../VS_visualcpp/Building-C-C---Isolated-Applications-and-Side-by-side-Assemblies.md)  
 Describes the deployment model for Windows Desktop applications, based on the idea of isolated applications and side-by-side assemblies.  
  
 [C/C++ Building Reference](../VS_visualcpp/C-C---Building-Reference.md)  
 Provides links to reference articles about program building in C++, compiler and linker options, and various build tools.  
  
 [Configuring Programs for 64-Bit](../VS_visualcpp/Configuring-Programs-for-64-Bit--Visual-C---.md)  
 Describes how to configure both Visual Studio and the command line to use the 64-bit toolset and how to target 64-bit architectures, and discusses common migration issues when code is moved to 64-bit architectures.  
  
 [Configuring Programs for ARM Processors](../VS_visualcpp/Configuring-Programs-for-ARM-Processors--Visual-C---.md)  
 Describes the conventions used by ARM processors, and discusses common migration issues when code is moved to ARM architectures.  
  
 [Configuring Programs for Windows XP](../VS_visualcpp/Configuring-Programs-for-Windows-XP.md)  
 Describes how to set the Platform Toolset to target Windows XP development.
