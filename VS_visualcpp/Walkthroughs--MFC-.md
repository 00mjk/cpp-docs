# Walkthroughs (MFC)
This section contains articles that walk you through various tasks associated with new MFC library features.  
  
## In This Section  
 [Walkthrough: Using the New MFC Shell Controls](../VS_visualcpp/Walkthrough--Using-the-New-MFC-Shell-Controls.md)  
 In this walkthrough, you will create an application that resembles File Explorer. You will create a window that contains two panes. The left pane will contain a [CMFCShellTreeCtrl](../VS_visualcpp/CMFCShellTreeCtrl-Class.md) object that will display your Desktop in a hierarchical view. The right pane will contain a [CMFCShellListCtrl](../VS_visualcpp/CMFCShellListCtrl-Class.md) that will show the files in the folder that is selected in the left pane.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Putting Controls On Toolbars](../VS_visualcpp/Walkthrough--Putting-Controls-On-Toolbars.md)  
 Modern MFC toolbars can host controls other than simple buttons. This article explains how to do it.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Adding a D2D Object to an MFC Project](../VS_visualcpp/Walkthrough--Adding-a-D2D-Object-to-an-MFC-Project.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a D2D object to a project and introduces how to use D2D.  
  
 [Walkthrough: Adding Animation to an MFC Project](../VS_visualcpp/Walkthrough--Adding-Animation-to-an-MFC-Project.md)  
 Demonstrates how to add a graphical object to a project and introduces how to animate it.
