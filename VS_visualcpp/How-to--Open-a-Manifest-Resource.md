# How to: Open a Manifest Resource
If you open a manifest resource from [Resource View](../VS_visualcpp/Resource-View-Window.md), the resource will open in binary format. To view the contents of a manifest resource in a more viewable format, you must open the resource from Solution Explorer.  
  
### To open a manifest resource in the Text Editor  
  
1.  With your project open in `Solution Explorer`, expand the **Resource Files** folder.  
  
2.  Double-click the .manifest file.  
  
     Your manifest resource opens in the Text Editor.  
  
### To open a manifest resource in another editor  
  
1.  In Solution Explorer, right-click the .manifest file and choose **Open With...** from the shortcut menu.  
  
2.  In the **Open With** dialog box, specify the editor you would like to use and click **Open**.  
  
 For information on adding resources to managed projects, please see [Resources in Applications](../Topic/Resources%20in%20Desktop%20Apps.md) in the *.NET Framework Developer's Guide.*
