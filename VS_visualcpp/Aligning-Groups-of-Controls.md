# Aligning Groups of Controls
The following procedure shows you how to align groups of controls.  
  
### To align groups of controls  
  
1.  [Select the controls](../VS_visualcpp/Selecting-Multiple-Controls.md) you want to align. Be sure to select the control that you want to be the dominant control first or set it to be the dominant control before executing the alignment or sizing command.  
  
     The final position of the group of controls depends on the position of the dominant control. For more information on selecting the dominant control, see [Specifying the Dominant Control](../VS_visualcpp/Specifying-the-Dominant-Control.md).  
  
2.  From the **Format** menu, choose **Align**, and then choose one of the following alignments:  
  
    -   **Lefts**: aligns the selected controls along their left sides.  
  
    -   **Centers**: aligns the selected controls horizontally along their center points.  
  
    -   **Rights**: aligns the selected controls along their right sides.  
  
    -   **Tops**: aligns the selected controls along their top edges.  
  
    -   **Middles**: aligns the selected controls vertically along their middle points.  
  
    -   **Bottoms**: aligns the selected controls along their bottom edges.
