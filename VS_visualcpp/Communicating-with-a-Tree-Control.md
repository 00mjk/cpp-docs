# Communicating with a Tree Control
You use different methods for calling member functions in a [CTreeCtrl](../VS_visualcpp/CTreeCtrl-Class.md) object depending on how the object was created:  
  
-   If the tree control is in a dialog box, use a member variable of type `CTreeCtrl` that you create in the dialog box class.  
  
-   If the tree control is a child window, use the `CTreeCtrl` object (or pointer) you used to construct the object.  
  
-   If you're using a `CTreeView` object, use the function [CTreeView::GetTreeCtrl](../Topic/CTreeView::GetTreeCtrl.md) to get a reference to the tree control. You can initialize another reference with this value or assign the address of the reference to a `CTreeCtrl` pointer.
