# Compiler Warning (level 4) C4837
trigraph detected: '??%c' replaced by '%c'  
  
 The detected trigraph is replaced by the indicated character.  
  
 The compiler translates trigraphs before any other processing is completed. Use the character escape sequence, `\?`, to prevent the misinterpretation of a character sequence that resembles a trigraph. For more information about trigraphs, see [Trigraphs](../VS_visualcpp/Trigraphs.md). For more information about escape sequences, see [Escape Sequences](../VS_visualcpp/Escape-Sequences.md).  
  
 C4837 is off by default. See [Compiler Warnings That Are Off by Default](../VS_visualcpp/Compiler-Warnings-That-Are-Off-by-Default.md) for more information.  
  
### To correct this error  
  
1.  Use the character escape sequence, `\?`, instead of one of the '?' characters in the source code.
